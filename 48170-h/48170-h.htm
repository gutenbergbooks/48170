<h2><a name="REVISION_AND_CONSOLIDATION_OF_THE_NATIONAL" id="REVISION_AND_CONSOLIDATION_OF_THE_NATIONAL"></a>REVISION AND CONSOLIDATION OF THE NATIONAL
STATUTES.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Resolution and Speech in the Senate, December 12, 1861.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>April 8, 1852, during his first session in the Senate, Mr. Sumner
brought forward a resolution for a revision and consolidation of the
national statutes, which was duly referred to the Committee on the
Judiciary.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Though the resolution attracted attention at the time,
the committee did nothing.</p>

<p>Early in the next Congress, December 14, 1853, he presented the
same resolution a second time, which was duly referred,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and again
neglected.</p>

<p>In the succeeding Congress, February 11, 1856, he offered the same
resolution a third time,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and with no better success than before.</p>

<p>Absence from the Senate and protracted disability prevented the
renewal of this effort until the administration of President Lincoln,
who was induced to make a recommendation on the subject in his
annual message of December 3, 1861.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Mr. Sumner followed, December
12th, with his oft-repeated resolution:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the Committee on the Judiciary be directed to consider
the expediency of providing by law for the appointment of commissioners to
revise the public statutes of the United States, to simplify their language,
to correct their incongruities, to supply their deficiencies, to arrange them
in order, to reduce them to one connected text, and to report them thus
improved to Congress for its final action, to the end that the public statutes,
which all are presumed to know, may be in such form as to be more within
the apprehension of all.”</p>

</div>

<p>Of this he spoke.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;It is now nearly ten years,
since, on first entering this Chamber, I had the
honor of presenting this identical resolution. Several
times afterwards, at succeeding sessions, I brought it
forward; but there was no action in regard to it, either
by the Committee on the Judiciary, to which it was
referred, or by the Senate. At last we have a positive
recommendation from the President in his Annual
Message, calling attention to the necessity of a revision
of our statutes, and of reducing them to a connected
text. I desire to take advantage of that recommendation,
and to revive the proposition which ten
years ago I first introduced.</p>

<p>Something in earnest, Sir, must be done. The ancient
Roman laws, when first codified, were so cumbersome
that they made a load for several camels. If
this cannot be said of our statutes, nobody will deny
that they are cumbersome, swelling to at least eleven
or twelve heavy volumes, besides being most expensive.
They are to be found in few public libraries, and very
rarely in private libraries. They ought to be in every
public library, and also in the offices of lawyers throughout
the country. That can be only by reducing them
in size so that they will form a single volume, which is
entirely practicable,&mdash;thus rendering them easy to read
and cheap to buy.</p>

<p>I have reason to believe, Sir, that such a work would
be agreeable to the people. I am not without assurance
that the people value such reading. Certainly I am justified
in this conclusion, when I think of my own State;
for it is within my knowledge that the statutes of Massachusetts,
reduced to a single volume, as they now are,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
have, during a very brief period, been purchased by the
people at large to the extent of more than ten thousand
copies.</p>

<p>I hope, Sir, there will be no objection founded on
the condition of the country. I do not forget the old
saying, that the laws are silent in the midst of arms;
but I would have our Republic show by example that
such is not always the case. I am sure we can do
nothing better for the honor of the Administration that
is ours. Indeed, should we not all look with increased
pride upon our country, most cherished when most in
peril, if, while dealing with a fearful Rebellion, Congress
turned aside to the edification of the people in
objects that are useful, among which I place that I now
propose? It will be something, if, through the din of
war, this work of peace proceeds, changing the national
statutes into a harmonious text, and making them accessible
to all.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The resolution was agreed to.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This was followed, January 28, 1862, by a bill, introduced by Mr.
Sumner, for the revision and consolidation of the statutes of the United
States, which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary. May 31,
the Committee, on motion of its chairman [Mr. <span class="smcap">Trumbull</span>], was discharged
from the further consideration of the resolution. At the same
time the bill was postponed to the first Monday in December, and expired
with the Congress.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>December 15, 1863, Mr. Sumner renewed his original resolution on
the subject, and on the 23d introduced another bill with the same
object, on which Mr. Trumbull, from the Committee, reported adversely,
June 28, 1864.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>January 5, 1866, Mr. Sumner renewed his effort by a bill, which
was also referred to the Judiciary Committee. February 7, Mr.
Poland, from the Committee, reported the bill favorably. April 9,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>it was considered in the Senate and passed without debate, substantially
as drawn and introduced by Mr. Sumner. In the original bill
the salaries of the commissioners were $3,000 each. On the report
of the Committee, they were changed to $5,000 each. June 22 the
bill passed the House of Representatives without amendment, and was
approved by the President June 27.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Under this Act, President Johnson appointed as commissioners Hon.
Caleb Cushing of Massachusetts, Hon. Charles P. James of Ohio, and
Hon. William Johnston of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>The period of three years, within which the revision and consolidation
were to be completed, having expired, leaving the work undone,
a supplementary Act of Congress was passed,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> continuing the original
Act, and under it President Grant appointed as commissioners Hon.
Benjamin Vaughan Abbott of New York, Hon. Charles P. James of
Ohio, and Hon. Victor C. Barringer of North Carolina.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sumner offered the following resolution, and asked for its present
consideration.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the Committee on Patents and the Patent Office be directed
to consider if any further legislation is necessary in order to secure
to persons of African descent, in our own country, the right to take out
patents for useful inventions, under the Constitution of the United States.”</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;If I can have the attention of
the Chairman of the Committee on Patents, I will
state to him why this resolution is introduced. It has
come to my knowledge that an inventor of African descent,
living in Boston, applied for a patent under the
Constitution and laws of the land, and was refused, on
the ground, that, according to the Dred Scott decision,
he is not a citizen of the United States, and therefore
a patent cannot issue to him. I wish the Committee
to consider whether in any way that abuse cannot be
removed. That is all.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The resolution was considered by unanimous consent, and agreed to.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Committee made no report on the resolution. It was a case for
interpretation rather than legislation, and the question, like that of
passports, was practically settled not long afterwards by the opinion
of the Attorney-General, that a free man of color, born in the United
States, is a citizen.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Since then patents have been issued to colored
inventors.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The abuses in Missouri, to which Mr. Sumner called attention, December
4, 1861, appeared even in the neighborhood of Washington,
almost under the eye of Congress, so that he felt it his duty to expose
them once more.</p>

<p>December 18, he spoke briefly on the following resolution, introduced
by himself the preceding day.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the Committee on Military Affairs and the Militia be
directed to consider the expediency of providing by additional legislation
that our national armies shall not be employed in the surrender of fugitive
slaves.”</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;Some days ago it was my
duty to expose abuses in Missouri in regard to fugitive
slaves. Since then I have received communications
from that State, showing great interest in the question,
some of them in the nature of protest against the system
adopted there. One purports to be from a slave-master,
educated in a Slave State, and he speaks with
bitterness of the indignity put upon the army there,
and of the injury it inflicts on the cause of the Union.
Another contains a passage which I shall read.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I wish to say in addition that I have lived twenty-four
years in Missouri, that I know the people well, have served
them in various offices; and let me assure you, it is nonsense
to try to save Missouri to the Union, and the institution
of Slavery also. We must give up one or the other.
Slavery ought to fall, and Missouri be saved. Fremont’s
army struck terror into the Secessionists. He made them
feel it by taking their goods and chattels. Let our armies
proclaim freedom to the slaves of the Secessionists and the
Rebellion will soon close. We can take care of the free
negroes at a future day; give General Lane ten thousand
men, and he would establish peace in Missouri in thirty
days.”</p>

</div>

<p>But, Sir, my special object now is, to exhibit wrong
here at home rather than in distant Missouri. Brigadier-General
Stone, the well-known commander at Ball’s
Bluff, is adding to his disaster there by engaging in the
surrender of fugitive slaves. He does this most successfully.
If a fugitive slave is to be handed over to a
Rebel, the General is easily victorious.</p>

<p>Sir, beside my constant interest in this question, beside
my interest in the honor of the national army, I
have a special interest at the present moment, because
Brigadier-General Stone sees fit to impose this vile and
unconstitutional duty upon Massachusetts troops. The
Governor of my honored State has charged me with a
communication to the Secretary of War, treating it as
an indignity to the men, and an act unworthy of the
flag. I agree with the Governor; and when I ask your
attention to this outrage, I make myself his representative,
as well as my own.</p>

<p>Others beside the Governor of Massachusetts complain.
There are two German companies in one of the Massachusetts
regiments, who entered into the public service
with the positive understanding that they should not
be put to any such discreditable and unconstitutional
service. They complain, and with them all their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
compatriot fellow-citizens, the enlightened, freedom-loving
German population throughout the country.</p>

<p>The complaint extends to other quarters. Here is a
letter from Philadelphia, interesting and to the point.
I read a short extract only.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have but one son, and he fought on Ball’s Bluff in the
California regiment, where his bravery brought him into
notice. He escaped, wounded, after dark. He protests
against being made to return fugitive slaves, and, if ordered
to that duty, will refuse obedience and take the consequences.
I ask, Sir, shall our sons, who are offering their
lives for the preservation of our institutions, be degraded to
slave-catchers for any persons, loyal or disloyal? If such is
the policy of the Government, I shall urge my son to shed
no more blood for its preservation.”</p>

</div>

<p>With such communications, some official and others
private, I feel that I should not do my duty, if I failed
to implore the attention of the Senate to this intolerable
grievance. It must be arrested. I am glad to know
that my friend and colleague, the Chairman of the Committee
on Military Affairs [Mr. <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>], promises us
a bill to stop this outrage. It should be introduced
promptly, and passed at once. Our troops must be
saved from such shame.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The resolution was adopted after remarks by Mr. Cowan, of Pennsylvania,
which revealed the tone still prevalent in certain quarters.
He said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I agree, that, if all men were Puritans, that, if all men appreciated Liberty
as we do, and as our race does, then we might extend it to all men; but
to extend it to men who have no appreciation of it, who would trample the
boon under foot, when granted them,&mdash;to such men it is a mischief rather
than a blessing.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
<p>“Still I have only to say, that I think we have nothing in the world to do
with all these questions. I think their discussion here, their being mooted
in these assemblies, is mischievous, and only calculated to keep up an angry
irritation, which may have exceedingly bad results in the final consummation
of the struggle in which we are now engaged.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Wilson, as chairman of the Committee, reported a bill on the
subject, which, after debate, gave way to another from the House of
Representatives, containing a new article of war, prohibiting the employment
of the national forces in the return of fugitive slaves, which
became a law March 13, 1862.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This movement of Mr. Sumner was followed by a personal incident.
General Stone, whose conduct was exposed with severity, took exception
to the speech, and addressed him a letter intended to be very insulting.
Mr. Sumner made no reply, nor did he utter any complaint
in any quarter. A few days later be received notice from Boston
that a near relative of the General had threatened to inflict personal
violence upon him. Some time afterwards General Stone was taken
into custody by military order, and for a long time incarcerated. The
hostile press and the General’s friends charged this upon Mr. Sumner,
often in most offensive terms, and it was repeated in the face of his constant
denial. April 21, 1862, the question of this arrest was considered
in the Senate, on motion of Mr. McDougall, of California, when Mr.
Sumner spoke briefly.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;I have no opinion to express on
the case of General Stone, for I know nothing about it.
Clearly he ought to be confronted with his accusers at
an early day, unless, indeed, there be some reason of
transcending military character, which, in the present
condition of the country, at a moment of war, might
render such a trial improper. Of this I do not pretend
to judge; nor am I aware of evidence on which
the Senate can now act.</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>I hope I shall be pardoned, if I allude to myself.
A most persistent attempt has been made in newspapers
to connect me with this arrest, to the extent of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>according to me and my imagined influence the credit
or the discredit of it. This is a mistake. I have been
from the beginning an absolute stranger to it. The
arrest was made originally without suggestion or hint
from me, direct or indirect, and it has been continued
without any such suggestion or hint from me. I knew
nothing about it at the beginning, and know nothing
about it now. There is no intimate friend or family
relative of the prisoner more entirely free from all connection
with it than myself.</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Resolution and Remarks in the Senate, December 18, 1861.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>December 18, 1861, Mr. Sumner offered the following resolution,
which, on his motion, was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That Trusten Polk, of Missouri, now a traitor to the United
States, be expelled, and he hereby is expelled, from the Senate.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner produced a letter from Mr. Polk, which had found its
way into the newspapers, where he says: “Dissolution is now a fact,&mdash;not
only a fact accomplished, but thrice repeated. Everything here
looks like inevitable and final dissolution. Will Missouri hesitate a
moment to go with her Southern sisters? I hope not.”</p>

<p>Mr. Saulsbury, of Delaware, thought the letter was “not genuine,”
and added:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He is a native of my own State; from early boyhood he has been an
exemplary Christian, a member of a religious denomination; and when the
phrase is used in that letter, professing to have been written by Trusten
Polk, that he had to ‘ante up $200,’ I am satisfied the language is not the
language of Trusten Polk. He is not familiar with scenes where hundreds
of dollars are ‘anted up.’”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner replied:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I do not pretend to an opinion on the genuineness
of the letter. Like the Senator from Delaware, I
have seen it in several newspapers, and my attention
has been specially called to it by correspondents in
Missouri, who write that its genuineness cannot be
doubted. But this is a question for the Committee.</p>

<p>If I understand the Senator, his argument against the
genuineness of the letter is founded on a phrase which
he thinks Trusten Polk could never have written: it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
is a phrase of doubtful style or taste, showing bad associations.
I am not familiar enough with Trusten Polk
to sit in judgment on his style, nor is the Senate called
to any such responsibility; but we are to sit in judgment
on his public conduct, and if the letter is not a
forgery, there can be no question as to our duty.</p>

<p>Believing the inquiry important, not doubting the
duty of the Senate to purge itself of traitors who have
too long found sanctuary in its Chamber, and satisfied
that the country justly expects this to be done, I have
felt bound to introduce the resolution.</p>

<p>But there is more than the letter. The Senate has
heard within a few days that this person has found his
way to Memphis. Why is he at Memphis, when he
should be at Washington?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Some time afterwards Mr. Sumner received from Missouri the very
letter, in the undoubted autograph of Mr. Polk, and with the phrase
which it was insisted he could not have written.</p>

<p>January 9, 1862, Mr. Ten Eyck, of New Jersey, reported the resolution
from the Committee, with the unanimous recommendation that it
pass.</p>

<p>January 10, the resolution was adopted without debate: Yeas, 36;
Nays, 0.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The case of the Trent was an important incident of the war,&mdash;most
interesting for a time to the people of the United States, attracting the
attention of foreign nations, and exciting England to hostile demonstrations,
even to the verge of practical coöperation with a Rebellion
for the sake of Slavery. The facts are few, and are authenticated by
official documents.</p>

<p>At an early stage of the Rebellion, the Slave-Masters of Richmond
appointed James M. Mason, of Virginia, commissioner and envoy to England,
and John Slidell, of Louisiana, in the same capacity to France, each
with a secretary, and also with instructions and despatches. Their
duty was to help the Rebellion, especially in its financial and military
exigencies, to urge its recognition, to make treaties of commerce and
alliance, to obtain European intervention, and generally to oppose the
diplomacy of the United States. As the Rebel ports were already under
strict blockade, and there were no Rebel vessels for their conveyance,
they were driven to rely upon accommodation under a neutral flag.
Some time in October, 1861, they succeeded in running the blockade
and reaching Havana. Here their pretensions and objects were notorious.
But this was only the first stage in the voyage. The next was
conveyance to Europe; and for this they relied upon the English flag,
taking passage in the Trent, bound from Havana to St. Thomas, from
which latter place a regular line of steamers, connecting with the Trent,
ran to England. Mr. Dana, in his excellent statement of the case,
says: “Their character and destination were well known to the agent
and master of the Trent, as well as the great interest felt by the Rebels
that they should, and by the United States officials that they should
not, reach their destination in safety.”<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The regular mails for England
from South America and Cuba were aboard, to be transferred at St.
Thomas, with a large number of passengers bound to England.</p>

<p>On the high seas, within a few hours’ sail of Nassau, the Trent was
stopped and searched by the national steamer San Jacinto, commanded
by Captain Wilkes, afterwards Rear-Admiral, acting on his own responsibility,
and without any instructions from the National Government.
The two commissioners and their secretaries were found aboard, but the
despatches were secreted or confided to some of the passengers. Here Mr.
Dana remarks: “There was no evidence or charge that the commander<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
of the Trent aided in the concealment or forwarding of these despatches.
He did, however, deny the right of search, refused all facilities for it,
and obstructed it by everything but actual force, and made it known to
Captain Wilkes that he yielded only to superior power, and that, if
made a prize, he and his crew would lend no aid in carrying the Trent
into port.”<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Under these circumstances, Captain Wilkes took the two
commissioners with their suite, and carried them as prisoners to the
United States, while the Trent proceeded on her voyage.</p>

<p>As this incident became known in the United States, there was a general
expression of sympathy and approbation. The press was unanimous.
Persons in authority gave their adhesion by public speech or writing,
among whom were Mr. Everett, Governor Andrew, Chief-Justice Bigelow
of Massachusetts, Professor Parsons of the Law School at Cambridge,
Mr. Caleb Cushing, and Mr. George Sumner, all of whom were
to a certain extent under the influence of British precedents.</p>

<p>The Secretary of the Navy, under date of November 30, 1861, addressed
a communication to Captain Wilkes, containing the following
significant words.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Your conduct in seizing these public enemies was marked by intelligence,
ability, decision, and firmness, and has the emphatic approval of this
Department. It is not necessary that I should in this communication, which
is intended to be one of congratulation to yourself, officers, and crew, express
an opinion on the course pursued in omitting to capture the vessel
which had these public enemies on board, further than to say that the forbearance
exercised in this instance must not be permitted to constitute a
precedent hereafter for infractions of neutral obligations.”<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The House of Representatives made haste, December 2, 1861, the
first day of its session, to adopt a joint resolution tendering the
thanks of Congress to Captain Wilkes, “for his brave, adroit, and
patriotic conduct in the arrest and detention of the traitors James
M. Mason and John Slidell.” This was on the motion of Hon.
Owen Lovejoy, the faithful Abolitionist. The joint resolution, on
reaching the Senate, was referred to the Committee on Naval Affairs,
of which Mr. Hale was chairman. Mr. Sumner suggested its reference
to the Committee on Foreign Relations; but Mr. Hale insisted,
by way of objection, that “the attempt now to take it out of its
ordinary course and refer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> it to the Committee on Foreign Relations
would be taken as an intimation that there is some doubt in some
minds as to the propriety of the course that Captain Wilkes took.”
Unwilling to raise a debate at that moment, Mr. Sumner assented to
the reference proposed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In England there was a counter sentiment, breaking out into expressions
of exasperation. The press was bitter and vindictive. Public
report attested a crisis, which may be read in the newspapers of Richmond,
throbbing sympathetically with the London organs.</p>

<p>The <i>Richmond Examiner</i>, of December 19, broke forth in notes of
triumph.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All other topics become trifles beside the tidings of England which occupy
this journal, and all commentary that diverts public attention from
that single point is impertinence. The effect of the outrage of the Trent on
the public sentiment of Great Britain more than fulfils the prophecy that we
made when the arrest of the Confederate ministers was a fresh event. All
legal quibbling and selfish calculation has been consumed like straw in the
burning sense of incredible insult.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then, speculating upon the position of the National Government, the
same journal says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Abolition element of the Northern States would go straight to revolution
at the least movement toward a surrender of the captives.… Spectators
of these events, who can doubt that the Almighty fiat has gone forth
against the American Union, or that the Southern Confederacy is decreed
by Divine Wisdom?”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Richmond Enquirer</i> of the same date likewise rejoiced.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We have no need to invite attention to the extremely interesting foreign
news which we publish to-day from England. The old British lion is giving
an honest roar, in view of the indignity visited upon the Queen’s flag.… We
will not disturb the eloquence of such facts by words of comment. We will
only say, Well done, John Bull! France, too, echoes the British indignation,
and will support her action. <i>Vive Napoléon!</i> … After the brave talk
and the congratulations to Wilkes by both Cabinet and Congress, it would
be to the last degree pusillanimous to retreat. We think Lincoln will be
afraid to prove so great a coward.”</p>

</div>

<p>Swiftly came the British demand, in a letter from Earl Russell to
Lord Lyons at Washington, dated at London, November 30, and read
to Mr. Seward December 19. It concluded in the following terms.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Her Majesty’s Government, therefore, trust, that, when this matter shall
have been brought under the consideration of the Government of the United
States, that Government will, of its own accord, offer to the British Government
such redress as alone could satisfy the British nation, namely, the liberation
of the four gentlemen and their delivery to your Lordship, in order
that they may again be placed under British protection, and a suitable apology
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>for the aggression which has been committed. Should these terms not
be offered by Mr. Seward, you will propose them to him.”<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

</div>

<p>“The four gentlemen,” being the commissioners and their secretaries,
all Rebels, were to be liberated forthwith, and “a suitable apology” was
to be made by the National Government. Such was the mandate. But
accompanying these instructions read to Mr. Seward was a private communication
to Lord Lyons, directing him to break up his legation and
to leave Washington, if the National Government did not submit to the
terms required after “a delay not exceeding seven days.” Here are the
words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Should Mr. Seward ask for delay, in order that this grave and painful
matter should be deliberately considered, you will consent to a delay not
exceeding seven days. If at the end of that time no answer is given, or if
any other answer is given except that of a compliance with the demands of
Her Majesty’s Government, your Lordship is instructed to leave Washington,
with all the members of your legation, bringing with you the archives of the
legation, and to repair immediately to London.… You will communicate
with Vice-Admiral Sir A. Milne immediately upon receiving the answer of
the American Government, and you will send him a copy of that answer,
together with such observations as you may think fit to make. You will
also give all the information in your power to the Governors of Canada,
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Jamaica, Bermuda, and such other of Her
Majesty’s possessions as may be within your reach.”<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These latter instructions, contemplating war, were unknown in our
country at the time of the settlement, and, when read in the calmness of
a period removed from the event, seem incomprehensible in spirit. They
are positive and peremptory, without recognizing any possibility of delay,
even for a proposal of arbitration. Plainly they announce, as the
British alternatives, instant surrender, with suitable apology, or war.
This is the conclusion of Mr. Dana, in his admirable note, and nobody
can doubt it.</p>

<p>In accord with this note was the conduct of the British Government,
making preparations for war; and here is unimpeachable British testimony.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Troops were despatched to Canada with all possible expedition; and that
brave and loyal colony called out its militia and volunteers, so as to be ready
to act at a moment’s notice. Our dock-yards here resounded with the din
of workmen getting vessels fitted for sea; and there was but one feeling,
which animated all classes and parties in the country, and that was a determination
to vindicate our insulted honor and uphold the inviolability of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>national flag.”<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At that moment the American Republic was straining every nerve to
suppress a Rebellion whose single declared object was the foundation of
a new government with Slavery as its corner-stone. War by England
was practical recognition of the new government, with alliance and
breaking of the blockade.</p>

<p>The difficulty in comprehending this attitude is increased, when it is
known that the British Government did not regard the seizure as authorized
by instructions. In his letter to Lord Lyons, Earl Russell says
expressly: “Her Majesty’s Government are willing to believe that the
United States naval officer who committed the aggression was not acting
in compliance with any authority from his Government.”<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Therefore
the National Government had done nothing,&mdash;absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>On the same day that Earl Russell indited his remarkable despatch,
Mr. Seward wrote from Washington to Mr. Adams, at London, on business
of the legation, and in his letter mentions that Captain Wilkes
“acted without any instructions from the Government.” He adds:
“We have done nothing on the subject to anticipate the discussion.”
The letter throughout is in the spirit of peace. After declaring his
inference “that the British Government is now awake to the importance
of averting possible conflict, and disposed to confer and act with
earnestness to that end,” Mr. Seward says, “If so, we are disposed to
meet them in the same spirit, as a nation chiefly of British lineage,
sentiments, and sympathies, a civilized and humane nation, a Christian
people,” and then adds, that the affair of the Trent “is to be met
and disposed of by the two Governments, if possible, in the spirit to
which I have adverted,”<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> that is, with a sense of “the importance of
averting possible conflict,” and a disposition “to confer and act with
earnestness to that end,” as a Christian people. It so happened that Mr.
Adams read this letter to Earl Russell on the very day that Lord Lyons
read the demand for surrender and apology to Mr. Seward; but the
British Government did not allow its pacific contents to become known,
and the war-fever went on. Here Mr. Dana aptly remarks: “The
truth seems to be, that, so long as they were uncertain whether their
menace of war might not lead to war, they could not afford to withdraw
the chief motive for the war-spirit in the British people, and to admit
that their warlike demonstration had been needless. Their popular
support depended upon a general belief in a necessity for their having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
accompanied their demand with the preparations and menace of war.”<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The extraordinary character of this demand was recognized at the
time in Europe. The Count de Gasparin, after describing it as “a
question of declaring war,” and an “ultimatum,” said: “Between
great nations, between sister nations, it was a strange opening. The
usage is hardly to commence with an <i>ultimatum</i>,&mdash;that is, to commence
with the end. Ordinarily, when there has been a misunderstanding or
regrettable act, especially when that act comes within a portion of the
Law of Nations which is yet full of obscurity, the natural opening is to
ask for explanations as to the intentions, and for reparation for what has
been done, without mixing therewith an immediate menace of rupture.”<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
After expressing astonishment that a demand of apology “figured in the
original programme,” which he pronounced entirely out of place, the
impartial Frenchman proceeds: “Seeing such haste and proclamation
so lofty of an exigence above debate, seeing the idea of an impious war
accepted with so much ease by some and with such joy so little dissembled
by others, Europe declared, without ambiguity or reserve, that, if England
were not miraculously saved from her own undertaking, that, if she
went so far as to fire a cannon at the North as an ally of the South,
she would tear with her own hands her principal titles to the respect of
the civilized world.”<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Rejecting the pretension that the maintenance
of peace was due to the “warlike measures of England,” the eloquent
moralist exclaims, “America has just rendered to England the most
signal service which ever a people rendered to another people,” and
this by refusing the war which was menaced,&mdash;a war, as painted by
him, where, in addition to untold calamity, would be the wretchedness
of striking at the liberty of the world in alliance with slave-traders.
How naturally he adds: “From the moment that she is only the ally
of slave-traders, she has abdicated.”<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The summary tone of the British Government and the contemporaneous
preparations for war enhanced the difficulties peculiar to such a
question; but it was easy to see, on examination, that the demand was
in substantial conformity with American precedents, and accordingly
the Rebels, who had been confined at Fort Warren, in Boston Harbor,
were handed over to the British Government.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While the question was under consideration by the Cabinet of President
Lincoln, and before any conclusion had been communicated to the
British Government, an incident occurred in the Senate which showed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>the feeling that sought expression. December 26th, Mr. Hale, of New
Hampshire, who had already avowed his sympathy with the act of
Captain Wilkes, found occasion to discuss it at some length, and to
denounce the idea of surrendering the Rebels. A few passages will
show the tone he adopted.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I believe that the Cabinet to-day and yesterday, and for some days
past, have had under consideration a measure which involves more of
good or evil to this country than anything that has ever occurred before:
I mean the surrender, on the demand of Great Britain, of the persons of
Messrs. Slidell and Mason. To my mind, a more fatal act could not mark
the history of this country,&mdash;an act that would surrender at once to the
arbitrary demand of Great Britain all that was won in the Revolution, reduce
us to the position of a second-rate power, and make us the vassal of
Great Britain.…</p>

<p>“I have seen many gentlemen, and I have seen none, not a man can be
found, who is in favor of this surrender; for it would humiliate us in the eyes
of the world, irritate our own people, and subject us to their indignant
scorn. If we are to have war with Great Britain, it will not be because we
refuse to surrender Messrs. Mason and Slidell: that is a mere pretence. If
war shall come, it will be because Great Britain has determined to force war
upon us. They would humiliate us first and fight us afterwards. If we are
to be humiliated, I prefer to take it after a war, and not before.…
I pray that this Administration will not surrender our national honor. I
tell them that hundreds and thousands and hundreds of thousands will rush
to the battle-field, and bare their breasts to its perils, rather than submit to
degradation.”<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner at that time had not seen the demand, and was without
any precise information on the subject, but felt it his duty to say something
by way of breakwater against the rising tide. He spoke briefly.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;The Senator has made his speech,
and then withdrawn his motion; he has accomplished
his object. For myself, Sir, I would rather meet this
question, truly important, when presented in a practical
form. The Senator treats it on an hypothesis; he
assumes that Great Britain has made an arrogant demand,
and then proceeds to denounce it. How does he
know that any such demand has been made? Who in
the Senate knows it? Who in the country knows i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>t?
I do not believe it,&mdash;will not believe it, except on
evidence.</p>

<p>The Senator says that he is not against arbitration.
How does he know that this is not the policy of the Administration?
But I know nobody here who can speak
for the Administration on this point.</p>

<p>I submit to the Senator that on both points he has
spoken too swiftly. There is no evidence to justify him
in belief that any arrogant demand has been made;
there is no evidence that can lead him to distrust the
fidelity of the Administration. Speaking for myself
and nobody else, I declare my conviction that the question
will be peaceably and honorably adjusted. I do
not believe that it is a question for war; and I hail
with gratitude the declaration of the honorable Senator
in favor of arbitration. This at least is pacific in what
must be called a war speech. But do not understand
me as intimating that such mode is under consideration.
I content myself with repeating, that the question is in
safe hands, and that it will be better for us to reserve
ourselves until it is presented in some practical form, or
at least on evidence, and not on mere hypothesis.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sumner had been with the President and his Cabinet the day
before, to read important letters just received from Mr. Cobden and Mr.
Bright; but he did not know the conclusion on the question. The
few words in reply to Mr. Hale were in the spirit of peace, and as such
were warmly welcomed by the public. The sympathy they awakened
attests the prevailing interest. A leading citizen of Providence wrote:
“Very many thanks for your mild rebuke of our friend Senator Hale,
when he mounted the war-horse.” Another in Boston adopted the
same vein: “For your wise words, after the war speech of Mr. Hale,
you have m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>y thanks, and the thanks of thousands who will never
express to you their feelings. I know you will exert your great
influence on the side of peace, and I rejoice that you have so much
moral power in this matter.” Rev. George C. Beckwith, Corresponding
Secretary of the American Peace Society, had promptly declared his
trust: “It is a matter of special congratulation, that the helm of our
Foreign Relations, so far as the Senate is concerned, is held at this
juncture in hands so worthy of our confidence. We trust that you and
your Committee will have all the wisdom and other qualities needed to
meet the case now before us just as it ought to be.” A friend holding
high office in Massachusetts augured new strength for Mr. Sumner in
the battle with Slavery: “Your decisive speech,” he wrote, “will do
much to raise you in the estimation of those who were alarmed by your
Emancipation doctrines, and who begin to see that you are right in that,
as well as other things.”</p>

<p>The confidence reposed had its responsibilities increased by his position
as Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, and, when
the surrender was announced, Mr. Sumner felt it a duty to do what he
could in reconciling the people to his conclusion, especially as he was
satisfied that the original taking of the Rebels could not be justified
without adopting most obnoxious British precedents. Besides, reform
in Maritime Law seemed to be involved in the discussion, and he was
not without hope of contributing to this important result. Therefore
he made an early occasion to address the Senate on the subject.</p>

<p>In his speech Mr. Sumner brought into strong relief the early and
long continued pretension of England to enter our ships and take our
sailors without trial of any kind, as Captain Wilkes had entered the
Trent and taken the Rebel agents. In presenting this point, he was
determined not only by the London press, which adopted the original
American objection to any such entry and taking, but also by the
unpublished opinions of the law advisers of the Crown, which he had
before him in manuscript.</p>

<p>The capture of the Rebels was known in London on the evening of
27th November. But some time before, on an intimation that such an
attempt might be made, the British Government had asked the opinion
of the law officers on the questions involved in such an act. An answer
was returned, bearing date 12th November, which was signed by
the Queen’s Advocate-General, the Attorney-General, and the Solicitor-General.
In this opinion it was stated: “The United States ship of
war may put a prize crew on board the West India steamer and carry
her off to a port of the United States for adjudication by a Prize Court
there; <em>but she would have no right to remove Messrs. Mason and Slidell
and carry them off as prisoners, leaving the ship to pursue her
voyage</em>.” This opinion was supposed to have greater value because it
was given sixteen days before anything on the subject had appeared in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>the London press. Afterwards the case of the Trent was submitted to
these law officers, and on the 28th of November they gave another
opinion in accordance with the former, where they say: “From on
board a merchant ship of a neutral power, pursuing a lawful and innocent
voyage, <em>certain individuals have been taken by force. They were
not apparently officers in the military or naval service of the Confederate
Government.</em>” They conclude that Her Majesty’s Government “will be
justified in requiring reparation for the international wrong which has
been on this occasion committed.” In conformity with this opinion,
Earl Russell, in his letter demanding the surrender, treated it simply as
a forcible taking of “certain individuals” from an innocent British vessel
at sea by an American ship of war, all of which had been too often
done by British ships of war with innocent American vessels at sea.</p>

<p>It will be observed that Earl Russell uses the most general language,
without specification; but the contemporaneous press dwelt on the single
point taken by the law officers. One of these is quoted in Mr.
Sumner’s speech.</p>

<p>In France, the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i> wrote, as if instructed from
Downing Street:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“England <em>confines herself</em> to denying that an officer can erect himself into
a judge in such a cause, the decision of which should belong only to a Court
of Admiralty. Captain Wilkes, <em>substituting himself arbitrarily for the judicial
authority</em>, alone competent to give a legal character to his prize, England
can see in the act which he committed on the Trent only an act of violence,
an outrage perpetrated against the British flag.”<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This single point found sudden favor in England. Nassau W. Senior,
the eminent economist, in close relations with the British Cabinet,
wrote to Mr. Sumner, under date of December 10: “We think that
Captain Wilkes <em>could not make himself judge in his own cause</em>; that
the utmost he could have done legally would have been to take the
Trent into an Admiralty Court.” Here the able Englishman simply
echoes the early and constant doctrine of our country; but others
among his countrymen did the same.</p>

<p>The intimate relations of Mr. Sumner with Mr. Cobden and Mr.
Bright, already existing, were quickened during this anxious period,
when these eminent English statesmen wrote constantly, full of friendship
for our country and anxious always for peace. The perfect freedom
of these communications may be judged by a passage in a letter of Mr.
Cobden.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I write to you, of course, in confidence; and I write to you what I would
not write to any other American,&mdash;nay, what it would be perhaps improper
for any other Englishman than myself to utter to any other American but
yourself. But we are, I think, both more of Christians and cosmopolitans
than British or Yankee.”</p>

</div>

<p>Intervening time and death have removed the seal of confidence, opening
what passed between them to the observation of history.</p>

<p>Mr. Cobden occupied himself especially to obtain important reforms in
International Law on the ocean. This was part of his scheme for disarmament;
and here Mr. Sumner was a fellow-laborer. He was anxious
that the attention suddenly directed to Maritime Rights should redound
to the good of the Human Family. His programme was given in a letter
dated December 5, and read by Mr. Sumner to President Lincoln and
his Cabinet, while considering the British demand, on the forenoon of
Christmas day. Mr. Cobden begins by quoting from the public letter
of General Scott, then at Paris.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am sure that the President and people of the United States would be
but too happy to let these men go free, unnatural and unpardonable as their
offences have been, if by it they could emancipate the commerce of the
world. Greatly as it would be to our disadvantage, at this present crisis, to
surrender any of these maritime privileges of belligerents which are sanctioned
by the Laws of Nations, I feel that I take no responsibility in saying
that the United States will be faithful to their traditional policy upon this
subject, and to the spirit of their political institutions.”</p>

</div>

<p>He then proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If I were in the position of your Government, I would act upon it, and
thus, by a great strategic movement, turn the flank of the European powers,
<em>especially of the governing classes of England</em>. I would propose to let Mason
and Slidell go, and stipulate, at the same time, for a complete abandonment
of the old code of Maritime Law as upheld by England and the European
powers. I would propose that private property at sea should be exempt
from capture by armed Government ships. On this condition I would give
in my adhesion to the abolition of privateering. I would propose that neutral
merchant vessels, in time of war, as in time of peace, should be exempt
from search, visitation, or detention, by armed Government vessels, when on
the ocean or high seas,&mdash;I mean when beyond that distance from the shore
which removes them from the jurisdiction of any maritime state. I would
propose to abolish blockades of purely commercial ports, excepting for articles
contraband of war.”</p>

</div>

<p>To these just and magnificent reforms Mr. Cobden returns in other
letters, dwelling on the abolition of blockades, but pressing upon our
country the duty of advancing all, and, in the ardor of appeal, exclaiming,
“Take high ground with Europe for a complete sweep of the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
maritime code, and then take your own time to deal with the Slave
States,” and concluding another letter with the words, “Recollect how
immensely you would gain in moral power by leading all Europe in the
path of civilization. You owe it to yourselves and us.”</p>

<p>This correspondence reveals the anxiety of good Englishmen, and also
the various reports by which the public mind was perplexed. In one
letter Mr. Cobden writes: “Everybody tells me that war is inevitable;
and yet I do not believe in war.” In another he mentions “an impression
in high quarters that Mr. Seward wishes to quarrel with this
country,” which he characterizes as “absurd enough.” In another he
alludes to the joint resolution of thanks to Captain Wilkes, adopted by
the House of Representatives, as “viewed here by our alarmist journals
as almost a declaration of war”; and, after mentioning that “grave
men, holding the highest post in your cultivated State of Massachusetts,
compliment Captain Wilkes for having given an affront to the British
lion,” he says, with point, “It makes it very hard for Bright and me
to contend against the British-lion party in this country.”</p>

<p>Even in this peculiar atmosphere his clearness of perception did not
fail, and Mr. Cobden saw the mistake of principle or policy involved in
the “impressment” of the Rebel agents. In the postscript of a letter
dated November 27, the very day when the taking was first known in
London, he wrote: “We are rather unprepared to find you exercising
in a strained manner the right of search, <em>inasmuch as you have been
supposed to be always the opponents of the practice</em>.”</p>

<p>In the same vein his eloquent colleague, Mr. Bright, wrote, under
date of December 5: “Our law officers are agreed and strong in their
opinion of the illegality of the seizure of the commissioners; <em>but I cannot
make out how or where it exceeds the course taken by English ships
of war before the War of 1812</em>. But all the people here, of course, accept
their opinion as conclusive on the law of the case.”</p>

<p>Thus directly from the opinions of the law officers, and also from
various testimony, including the press, is it apparent that the special
objection of England was founded on the forcible taking of “certain
individuals” from a British vessel.</p>

<p>Naturally, therefore, Mr. Sumner planted himself on the early American
postulate, constantly maintained by us and constantly denied by
England. In the able note already cited Mr. Dana sums up the result.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This celebrated case can be considered as having settled but one principle,
and that had substantially ceased to be a disputed question: viz., that
a public ship, though of a nation at war, cannot take persons out of a neutral
vessel at sea, whatever may be the claim of her Government on those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>persons.”<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Seward was, therefore, right, when, in his communication to Lord
Lyons, he announced the settlement of the case “upon principles confessedly
American.”<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> In similar spirit, Prince Gortschakoff, in behalf
of the Russian Cabinet, congratulated our Republic upon “remaining
faithful to the political principles which she has always maintained,
even when those principles were turned against her, and abstaining
from invoking in her turn the benefit of doctrines which she has always
repudiated.”<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> And Baron Ricasoli, speaking for the Italian Cabinet,
would not believe that the Government at Washington “desired
to change its character all at once, and become the champion of theories
which history has shown to be calamitous, and which public opinion
has condemned forever.”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The correspondence “in relation to the recent removal of certain
citizens of the United States from the British mail-steamer Trent,” including
the letter of Earl Russell and the reply of Mr. Seward, and also
the letter of M. Thouvenel, Minister of Foreign Affairs in France, was
communicated to the Senate January 6, 1862. Its reference to the
Committee on Foreign Relations was, on motion of Mr. Sumner, made
the special order for January 9th, at one o’clock, when he made his
speech.</p>

<p>January 7th, two days before Mr. Sumner’s speech, the subject was
discussed in the House of Representatives, and strong speeches were
made against the surrender. Mr. Vallandigham, of Ohio, a leading
Democrat, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I avail myself of this, the earliest opportunity yet presented, to express
my utter and strong condemnation, as one of the Representatives of the people,
of the act of the Administration surrendering Mr. Mason and Mr. Slidell
to the British Government.… In six days after the imperious and peremptory
demand of Great Britain they were abjectly surrendered, upon the
mere rumor of the approach of a hostile fleet; and thus, Sir, for the first
time in our national history, have we strutted insolently into a quarrel without
right and then basely crept out of it without honor; and thus, too, for
the first time, has the American eagle been made to cower before the British
lion.”<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then again the same Democratic Proslavery orator said:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I would prefer a war with England to the humiliation which we have
tamely submitted to; and I venture the assertion that such a war would
have called into the field five hundred thousand men who are not now there,
and never will be without it, and have developed an energy and power in
the United States which no country has exhibited in modern times, except
France, in her great struggle in 1793.”<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In equal opposition to the British demand, Mr. B. F. Thomas, of
Massachusetts, an able lawyer, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The surrender is made, the thing done. In the presence of great duties
we have no time for the luxury of grief. Complaint of the Government
would be useless, if not groundless. It was too much to ask of it to take another
war on its hands.… But we are not called upon, Mr. Speaker, to
say that the demand was manly or just. It was unmanly and unjust. It
was a demand which, in view of her history, of the rights she had always
claimed and used as a belligerent power, of the principles which her greatest
of jurists, Lord Stowell, had imbedded in the Law of Nations, England
was fairly estopped to make.… When the matter is more carefully
weighed, it will be seen and felt that no wrong was done to England,&mdash;that
there was no wrong in the forbearance to exercise an extreme right,&mdash;no
insult, for none was intended,&mdash;that our feeling, if any, leaned to virtue’s
side, was a relaxation of the iron rigor of law from motives of humanity and
Christian courtesy,&mdash;that, on the other hand, England has done to us a great
wrong, in availing herself of our moment of weakness to make a demand,
which, accompanied as it was by the ‘pomp and circumstance of war,’ was
insolent in spirit and thoroughly unjust.… But the loss will ultimately
be hers. She is treasuring up to herself wrath against the day of wrath.
She has excited in the hearts of this people a deep and bitter sense of wrong,
of injury inflicted at a moment when we could not respond. It is night with
us now; but through the watches of the night, even, we shall be girding ourselves
to strike the blow of righteous retribution.”<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In similar spirit, Mr. Wright, of Pennsylvania, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Let England take them; if she has a mind to fête and toast them, let
her do it,&mdash;it is none of our business; if England desires to make lions of
Confederate Rebels, it is a mere matter of taste. If they have to be surrendered,
then let them be surrendered under a protest, while we shall remember
hereafter that there is a matter to be cancelled between the British
Government and the United States of North America.”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These utterances show elements in the atmosphere when Mr. Sumner
spoke. With many there was grief mingled with indignation, while
others who accepted the result felt a new burden added to the war.
Something was needed as a rally.</p>

</div>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<h3>SPEECH.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;Every principle of International
Law, when justly and authoritatively settled,
is a safeguard of peace and a landmark of civilization.
It constitutes part of that code which is the
supreme law, above all municipal laws, binding the
whole Commonwealth of Nations. Such a settlement
may be by a general Congress of Nations, as at Munster,
Vienna, or Paris; or it may be through the general
accord of treaties; or it may be by a precedent established
under such conspicuous circumstances, with all
nations as assenting witnesses, that it becomes at once
a commanding rule of international conduct. Especially
is this the case, if disturbing pretensions, long
maintained to the detriment of civilization, are practically
renounced. Without congress or treaty, such a
precedent is now established.</p>

<p>Surely it ought to be considered and understood in
its true character. Undertaking to explain it, I shall
speak for myself alone; but I shall speak frankly, according
to the wise freedom of public debate, and the
plain teachings of history on the question involved,
trusting sincerely that what I utter may contribute
something to elevate the honest patriotism of the country,
and perhaps to secure that tranquil judgment under
which this precedent will be the herald, if not the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
guardian, of international harmony.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two old men and two younger associates, recently
taken from the British mail packet Trent, on the high
seas, by order of Captain Wilkes of the United States
Navy, and afterwards detained in custody at Fort Warren,
are liberated and placed at the disposition of the
British Government. This is at the instance of that
Government, made on the assumption that the original
capture was an act of violence constituting an
affront to the British flag, and a violation of International
Law. This is a simple outline of the facts. To
appreciate the value of the precedent, other matters
must be brought into view.</p>

<p>These two old men were citizens of the United States,
and for many years Senators. Arrogant, audacious,
persistent, perfidious,&mdash;one was author of the Fugitive
Slave Bill, and the other was chief author of the filibustering
system which has disgraced our national name
and disturbed our national peace. Occupying places of
trust and power in the service of the country, they conspired
against it, and at last the secret traitors and conspirators
became open rebels. The present Rebellion,
surpassing in proportions and in wickedness any rebellion
in history, was from the beginning quickened and
promoted by their untiring energies. That country to
which they owed love, honor, and obedience, they betrayed
and gave over to violence and outrage. Treason,
conspiracy, and rebellion, each in succession, acted
through them. The incalculable expenditures now tasking
the national resources,&mdash;the untold derangement of
affairs, not only at home, but abroad,&mdash;the levy of
armies without example,&mdash;the devastation of extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
spaces of territory,&mdash;the plunder of peaceful ships on
the ocean, and the slaughter of fellow-citizens on the
murderous battle-field,&mdash;such are some of the consequences
proceeding directly from them.</p>

<p>To carry forward still further the gigantic crime of
which they were so large a part, these two old men,
with their two younger associates, stole from Charleston
on board a Rebel steamer, and, under cover of darkness
and storm, running the surrounding blockade and
avoiding the national cruisers, succeeded in reaching
the neutral island of Cuba, where, with open display
and the knowledge of the British consul, they embarked
on board the British mail packet Trent, bound for St.
Thomas, whence they were to embark for England, in
which kingdom one of them was to play the part of
Ambassador of the Rebellion, while the other was to
play the same part in France. The original treason,
conspiracy, and rebellion, of which they were so heinously
guilty, were all continued on this voyage, which
became a prolongation of the original crime, destined
to still further excess through their ambassadorial pretensions,
which it was hoped would array two great
nations against the United States, and enlist them
openly in support of an accursed Slaveholding Rebellion.
While on their way, the pretended ambassadors
were arrested by Captain Wilkes, of the United States
steamer San Jacinto, an accomplished officer, already
well known by scientific explorations, who on this
occasion acted without instructions from his Government.
If in this arrest he forgot for a moment the
fixed policy of the Republic, which has been from the
beginning like a frontlet between the eyes, and transcended
the Law of Nations, as the United States have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
always declared it, his apology will be found in the
patriotic impulse by which he was inspired, and the
British examples he could not forget. They were
the enemies of his country, embodying in themselves
the triple essence of worst enmity,&mdash;treason, conspiracy,
and rebellion; and they bore a professed ambassadorial
character, which, as he supposed, according
to high British authority, rendered them liable to be
stopped, while, as American citizens, they were liable
to seizure by the National Government in strict conformity
with long continued British practice. If, in the
ardor of an honest nature, Captain Wilkes erred, he
might well say,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,</div>
<div class="verse">Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man.</div>
<div class="verse">The expedition of my violent love</div>
<div class="verse">Outran the pauser reason.…</div>
<div class="verse">… Who could refrain,</div>
<div class="verse">That had a heart to love, and in that heart</div>
<div class="verse">Courage to make his love known?”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If this transaction be regarded exclusively in the
light of British precedents, if we follow the seeming
authority of the British Admiralty, speaking by its
greatest voice, and especially if we accept the oft
repeated example of British cruisers, upheld by the
British Government against the oft repeated protests
of the United States, we find little difficulty in vindicating
it. The act becomes questionable only when
brought to the touchstone of those liberal principles
which from the earliest times the American Government
has openly avowed and sought to advance,
and other European nations have accepted with regard
to the sea. Great Britain cannot complain, except by
adopting those identical principles; and should we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
undertake to vindicate the act, it can be only by repudiating
those identical principles. Our two cases
will be reversed. In the struggle between Laertes and
Hamlet, the combatants exchanged rapiers, so that
Hamlet was armed with the rapier of Laertes, and Laertes
with the rapier of Hamlet. And now, on this sensitive
question, a similar exchange occurs. Great Britain
is armed with American principles, while to us are
left only those British pretensions which throughout
our history have been constantly, deliberately, and solemnly
rejected.</p>

<p>Earl Russell, in his despatch to Lord Lyons, communicated
to Mr. Seward, contents himself by saying
that “it appears that certain individuals have been
forcibly taken from on board a British vessel, the ship
of a neutral power, <em>while such vessel was pursuing a
lawful and innocent voyage</em>,&mdash;an act of violence which
was an affront to the British flag, and a violation of
International Law.”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Here is positive assertion that
the ship, notoriously having on board the Rebel emissaries,
was pursuing a lawful and innocent voyage;
but there is no specification of the precise ground on
which the act is regarded as a violation of International
Law. Of course, it is not an affront; for an
accident can never be an affront to an individual or
to a nation.</p>

<p>But public report, authenticated by various authorities,
English and Continental, forbids us to continue
ignorant of the precise ground on which this act is
presented as a violation of International Law. It is
admitted that a United States man-of-war, meeting a
British mail steamer beyond the territorial limits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Great Britain, may subject her to visitation and search;
also that such man-of-war might put a prize crew on
board the British steamer, and take her to a port of
the United States for adjudication by a Prize Court
there; but it is alleged that she would have no right
to remove the individuals, not apparently officers in
the military or naval service, and carry them off as
prisoners, leaving the ship to pursue her voyage.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
Under the circumstances, in the exercise of a belligerent
right, the British steamer, with all on board, might
have been captured and carried off; but, according to
the British law officers, on whose professional opinion
the British Cabinet acted, the whole proceeding was
vitiated by failure to take the packet into port for
condemnation. This failure is the occasion of much
unprofessional objurgation; and we are emphatically
and constantly reminded that the custody of the
individuals in question could not be determined by
a navy officer on his quarter-deck, so as to supersede
the adjudication of a Prize Court. This is confidently
stated by an English writer, assuming to put the case
for his Government, as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is not to the right of search that we object, <em>but to the
following seizure without process of law</em>. What we deny is
<em>the right of a naval officer to stand in place of a Prize Court</em>,
and adjudicate, sword in hand, with a <i>sic volo, sic jubeo</i>, on the
very deck which is a part of our territory.”<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The same authority flourishes the same objection
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“If Captain Wilkes and his irresponsible supporters imagine
that we shall submit to the <em>arbitrary, semi-barbarous
practice</em>, they will in a few days be undeceived; for our
Government has instructed Lord Lyons to demand reparation
for so wanton a breach of friendly relations.”<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such declarations in an important journal, and in
precise harmony with the opinions of the British law
officers, seem semi-official in character.</p>

<p>Thus it appears that the present complaint of the
British Government is not founded on any assumption
by the American war steamer of the belligerent right of
search,&mdash;nor on the ground that this right was exercised
on a neutral vessel between two neutral ports,&mdash;nor
that it was exercised on a mail steamer, sustained
by subvention from the Crown, and officered in part from
the royal navy,&mdash;nor that it was exercised in a case
where the penalties of contraband could not attach; but
it is founded simply and precisely on the idea that persons
other than apparent officers in the military or naval
service cannot be taken out of a neutral ship at the
mere will of the officer exercising the right of search,
and without any form of trial. Therefore the Law of
Nations has been violated, and the conduct of Captain
Wilkes must be disavowed, while men who are traitors,
conspirators, and rebels, all in one, are allowed to go
free.</p>

<p>Surely, that criminals, though dyed in guilt, should
go free, is better than that the Law of Nations should
be violated, especially in any rule by which war is restricted
and the mood of peace is enlarged; for the Law
of Nations cannot be violated without overturning the
protection of the innocent as well as the guilty. On
this general principle there can be no question. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
but an illustration of that important maxim, recorded
in the Latin of Fortescue, “Better that twenty guilty
should escape than one innocent man should suffer,”<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
with this difference, that in the present case four guilty
ones escape, while the innocent everywhere on the sea
obtain new security. And this security becomes more
valuable as a triumph of civilization, when it is considered
that it was long refused, even at the cannon’s
mouth.</p>

<p>Remember, Sir, that the question in this controversy
is <em>strictly a question of law</em>,&mdash;precisely like a question
of trespass between two neighbors. The British Cabinet
began proceedings by taking the opinion of their law
advisers, precisely as an individual begins proceedings
in a suit at law by taking the opinion of his attorney.
To make such a question <em>a case of war</em>, or to suggest
that war is a proper mode of deciding it, is simply to
revive, on a gigantic scale, the exploded Ordeal by
Battle, and to imitate those dark ages when such proceeding
was openly declared to be the best and most
honorable mode of deciding even an abstract point of
law. “It was a matter of doubt and dispute,” says a
mediæval historian, “whether the sons of a son ought
to be reckoned among the children of the family, and
succeed equally with their uncles, if their father happened
to die while their grandfather was alive. An
assembly was called to deliberate on this point, and
it was the general opinion that it ought to be remitted
to the examination and decision of judges. But the
Emperor, following a better course, and desirous of dealing
honorably with his people and nobles, appointed the
matter to be decided by battle between two champion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>s.”<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
In similar spirit has it been latterly proposed, amidst
the amazement of the civilized world, to withdraw the
point of law, now raised by Great Britain, from peaceful
adjudication, and submit it to Trial by Combat. The
irrational anachronism becomes more flagrant from the
inconsistency of the party making it; for it cannot be
forgotten, that, in times past, <em>on this identical point of
law</em>, Great Britain persistently held an opposite ground
from that she now takes. Hereafter, in a happier moment,
this exacting power may regret the swiftness with
which she undertook to gird herself for unnatural combat,
on a mere point of law, with a friendly nation already
struggling against domestic enemies,&mdash;especially
as impartial history must record that her heavy sword
was to be thrown into the scale of Slavery.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The British complaint seems narrowed to a single
point, although there are yet other points, on which,
had the ship been carried into port for adjudication,
controversy must have arisen. The four following have
been presented in the case.</p>

<p>1. That the seizure of the Rebel emissaries, without
taking the ship into port, was wrong, <em>inasmuch as a
navy officer is not entitled to substitute himself for a
judicial tribunal</em>.</p>

<p>2. That, had the ship been carried into port, it would
not have been liable on account of the Rebel emissaries,
inasmuch as neutral ships are free to carry all persons
not apparently in the military or naval service of the
enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Are despatches contraband of war, so as to render
the ship liable to seizure?</p>

<p>4. Are neutral ships, carrying despatches, liable to be
stopped between two neutral ports?</p>

<p>These I shall consider in their order, giving special
attention to the first, which is the pivot of the British
complaint. If, in this discussion, I expose grievances
which it were better to forget, be assured it is from no
willingness to revive the buried animosities they once
so justly aroused, but simply to exhibit the proud position
which the United States early and constantly
maintained.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A question of International Law should not be presented
on any mere <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>. It would
be of little value to show that Captain Wilkes was sustained
by British authority and practice, if he were condemned
by International Law as interpreted by his own
country. It belongs to us now, nay, let it be our pride,
at any cost of individual prepossession or transitory
prejudice, to uphold that law in all its force, as it was
often declared by the best men in our history, and illustrated
by national acts; and let us seize the present occasion
to consecrate its positive and unequivocal recognition.
In exchange for the prisoners set free, we receive
from Great Britain a practical assent, too long
deferred, to a principle early propounded by our country,
and standing forth on every page of our history.
The same voice that asks for their liberation renounces
in the same breath an odious pretension, for whole generations
the scourge of peaceful commerce.</p>

<p>Great Britain, throughout her municipal history, has
practically contributed to the establishment of freedom
beyond all other nations. There are at least seven institutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
or principles which she has given to civilization:
first, the trial by jury; secondly, the writ of <i>Habeas Corpus</i>;
thirdly, the freedom of the press; fourthly, bills of
rights; fifthly, the representative system; sixthly, the
rules and orders of debate, constituting Parliamentary
Law; and, seventhly, the principle that the air is too
pure for a slave to breathe,&mdash;long ago declared, and first
made a conspicuous reality, by British law. No other
nation can show such peaceful triumphs. But, while
thus entitled to gratitude for glorious contributions to
Municipal Law, we turn with dissent and sorrow from
much which she has sought to fasten upon International
Law. In municipal questions, Great Britain drew inspiration
from her own native Common Law, instinct with
freedom; but, especially in maritime questions arising
under the Law of Nations, this power seems to have
acted on that obnoxious principle of the Roman Law,
positively discarded in municipal questions, <i>Quod principi
placuit legis vigorem habet</i>, and too often, under
this inspiration, imposed upon weaker nations her own
arbitrary will. A prerogative of the English monarch,
mentioned in very express and pompous terms by early
writers, was “the Custody of the Sea,” and he is frequently
styled “The Sovereign Lord and Proprietor of
the Sea.” But beyond these titles, the time has been
when she pretended to actual sovereignty over the seas
surrounding the British Isles, as far as Cape Finisterre
to the south, and Vanstaten in Norway to the north.
Driven from this lordly pretension, other pretensions,
less local, but hardly less offensive, were avowed.
The boast of “Britannia rules the waves” was practically
adopted by British Prize Courts, and universal
maritime rights were subjected to the special exigencies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
of British interests. In the consciousness of
strength, and with an irresistible navy, this power has
put chains upon the sea.</p>

<p>The commerce of the United States, as it began to
whiten the ocean, was cruelly decimated. American
ships and cargoes, while, in the language of Earl Russell,
“pursuing a lawful and innocent voyage,” suffered
from British Prize Courts more than from rock or tempest.
Shipwreck was less frequent than confiscation,
and, when it came, was easier to bear. But the loss
of property stung less than the outrage of impressment,
by which foreigners, under protection of the American
flag, and also American citizens, without any form of
trial, and at the mere mandate of a navy officer, who for
the moment acted as a judicial tribunal, were dragged
from the deck which should have been to them a sacred
altar. This outrage, insolently vindicated by the municipal
claim of Great Britain to the services of her subjects,
was enforced arrogantly and perpetually on the
high seas, where Municipal Law is silent and International
Law alone prevails. The belligerent right of
search, derived from International Law, and justly applicable
to enemy property or contraband only, and not
to men, was employed for this purpose, and the quarter-deck
of every English cruiser became a floating judgment-seat.
The leading organ of opinion in England,
on the morning after the news that the Rebels had been
taken from a British ship, thus confessed the precedents
of British history:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Unwelcome as the truth may be, it is nevertheless a
truth, that we have ourselves established a system of International
Law which now tells against us. In high-handed
and almost despotic manner, we have, in former days, claimed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>privileges over neutrals which have at different times banded
all the maritime powers of the world against us. <em>We have
insisted even upon stopping the ships of war of neutral nations
and taking British subjects out of them.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The practice began early and was continued constantly;
nor did it discriminate among its victims. It
is mentioned by Mr. Jefferson, and repeated by an excellent
British writer on International Law, that two
nephews of Washington, on their way home from Europe,
were ravished from the protection of the American
flag, without any judicial proceedings, and placed,
as common seamen, under the ordinary discipline of
British ships of war.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> The victims were counted by
thousands. Lord Castlereagh himself admitted, on the
floor of the House of Commons, that an inquiry instituted
by the British Government had discovered in the
British fleet three thousand five hundred men claiming
to be impressed Americans,&mdash;claiming only. But
while unwilling to accept this large number as all
Americans, his Lordship could not deny, “that, in the
great extent of the British navy, there were sixteen or
seventeen hundred individuals who were there contrary
to the wishes of His Majesty’s Government, and who
had some rational ground for demanding their liberation,
on the ground of their being subjects of the United
States,”&mdash;which, I take it, is a pleonastic circumlocution
to denote that at least sixteen hundred American
citizens were originally kidnapped and stolen from
American ships on the high seas, to undergo the servitude
of the British navy: all of which can be read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
in the Parliamentary Debates.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> At our Department of
State upwards of six thousand cases were recorded, and
it was estimated that at least as many more might have
occurred, of which no information had been received.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
Thus, according to official admission of the British minister,
there was reason to believe that the quarter-deck of
a British man-of-war had been made a floating judgment-seat
three thousand five hundred times, while, according
to the records of our own State Department, it had been
made a floating judgment-seat six thousand times and
upwards, and each time some citizen or other person
was taken from the protection of the national flag without
any form of trial whatever. If a pretension so intrinsically
lawless could be sanctioned by precedent,
Great Britain would have succeeded in interpolating it
into the Law of Nations.</p>

<p>The numbers sacrificed have been often denied on the
other side; but candid Englishmen have made admissions
which are on record. The “Edinburgh Review,”
at a moment when its authority was at its height, and
truth prevailed above controversy, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The two lists made out in 1801 and 1812 of impressed
Americans can be but a small part of the American case
against us. From that fraction of their case we may, however,
form some opinion on the extent to which freemen,
who would be a scandal to their English ancestry, unless
liberty was as dear as life, must have writhed under our
practice of impressment. Prior to September, 1801, 1,132
native American sailors were set at liberty by the English
Government, as having been wrongfully impressed. On the
war with America in 1812, another division of 1,422 native
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>Americans, every one of them having been so taken, were
transferred out of our men-of-war into our prisons. This is
proved from English documents. Here are nearly two thousand
six hundred sufferers, victims of a greater outrage than
one free nation ever assumed the privilege of inflicting on
another,&mdash;an outrage which no nation deserving the name
of a nation, and solemnly bound to protect its meanest members,
can be expected patiently to endure.”<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such words by one of us might be treated as the
exaltation of patriotic indignation. Here, it is history
written by the other side.</p>

<p>Even assuming, that, according to frequent British
allegation, the persons taken were British subjects and
not American citizens, which would make the act identical
with that of Captain Wilkes, this only presents in
stronger relief the precise point now in issue. Whether
the victims were American citizens or British subjects,
there was in each case the same forcible entry of our
ships and taking from our decks.</p>

<p>Protest, argument, negotiation, correspondence, and
war itself&mdash;unhappily the last reason of republics, as
of kings&mdash;were all employed by the United States in
vain to procure renunciation of the intolerable pretension.
The ablest papers in our diplomatic history are
devoted to this purpose; and the only serious war in
which we have been engaged, until summoned to subdue
the Rebellion, was to overcome by arms this very
tyranny, which would not yield to reason. Beginning
in the last century, the correspondence is at length
closed by the recent reply of Mr. Seward to Lord Lyons.
The long continued occasion of conflict is now happily
removed, and the pretension disappears forever,&mdash;to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
take its place among the barbaric curiosities of the
past.</p>

<p>But I do not content myself with asserting the persistent
opposition of the American Government. It
belongs to the argument that I should exhibit this
opposition, and the precise ground on which it was
placed,&mdash;being identical with that now adopted by
Great Britain. Here the testimony is complete. If
you will kindly follow me, you shall see it from the
beginning in the public life of our country, and in the
authentic records of the National Government.</p>

<p>This British pretension aroused and startled the administration
of Washington, and the pen of Mr. Jefferson,
his Secretary of State, was enlisted against it. In
a letter to Thomas Pinckney, Minister at London, dated
June 11, 1792, he announced the American doctrine.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The simplest rule will be, that the vessel being American
shall be evidence that the seamen on board her are
such.”<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In another letter to the same minister, dated October
12, 1792, he calls attention to a case of special outrage.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I enclose you a copy of a letter from Messrs. Blow and
Melhaddo, merchants of Virginia, <em>complaining of the taking
away of their sailors</em> on the coast of Africa by the commander
of a British armed vessel. So many instances of this kind
have happened, that it is quite necessary that their Government
should explain themselves on the subject, and be led
to disavow and punish such conduct.”<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At a later day, also under the administration of
Washington, Mr. Pickering, at that time Secretar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>y of
State, in a letter to Rufus King, Minister at London,
dated June 8, 1796, after repeating the rule proposed
by Mr. Jefferson, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But it will be an important point gained, <em>if, on the high
seas, our flag can protect those, of whatever nation, who shall
sail under it</em>. And for this humanity, as well as interest,
powerfully pleads.”<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The same pretension was put forth under the administration
of John Adams, and was again encountered.
Mr. Marshall, afterwards the venerated Chief Justice of
the United States, and at the time Secretary of State, in
his instructions to Rufus King, at London, dated September
20, 1800, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The impressment of our seamen is an injury of very
serious magnitude, which deeply affects the feelings and the
honor of the nation.… Alien seamen, not British subjects,
engaged in our merchant service, ought to be equally
exempt with citizens.… Britain has no pretext of right
to their persons or to their service. <em>To tear them, then,
from our possession is at the same time an insult and an
injury.</em> It is an act of violence for which there exists no
palliative.”<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The same pretension showed itself constantly under
the administration of Mr. Jefferson. Throughout the
eight years of his Presidency, the repeated outrages of
British cruisers never for a moment allowed it to be
forgotten. Mr. Madison, during this full period, was
Secretary of State, and none of the varied productions
of his pen are more masterly than those in which he
exposed this tyranny. In the course of the discussion
he showed the special hardship found in the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
sailors were taken from the ship at the mere will of an
officer, without any form of judicial proceedings, and
thus early presented against the pretension of Great
Britain the precise objection now adopted by her. Here
are his emphatic words, in the celebrated instructions to
Mr. Monroe, our Minister at London, dated January 5,
1804:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Taking reason and justice for the tests of this practice,
<em>it is peculiarly indefensible, because it deprives the dearest
rights of persons of a regular trial</em>, to which the most inconsiderable
article of property captured on the high seas
is entitled, and <em>leaves their destiny</em> to the will of an officer,
sometimes cruel, often ignorant, and generally interested,
by his want of mariners, in his own decisions. Whenever
property found in a neutral vessel is supposed to be liable,
on any grounds, to capture and condemnation, the rule in all
cases is, that the question shall not be decided by the captor,
but be carried before a legal tribunal, where a regular
trial may be had, and where the captor himself is liable to
damages for an abuse of his power. Can it be reasonable,
then, or just, that a belligerent commander, who is thus restricted
and thus responsible in a case of mere property of
trivial amount, should be permitted, <em>without recurring to any
tribunal whatever, to examine the crew of a neutral vessel, to
decide the important question of their respective allegiances</em>, and
to carry that decision into instant execution, by forcing every
individual he may choose into a service abhorrent to his
feelings, cutting him off from his most tender connections,
exposing his mind and his person to the most humiliating
discipline, and his life itself to the greatest dangers? Reason,
justice, and humanity unite in protesting against so extravagant
a proceeding.”<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>Negotiations on this principle, thus distinctly enunciated,
were intrusted at London to James Monroe, afterwards
President of the United States, and William
Pinkney, the most accomplished master of Prize Law
our country has produced. But they were unsuccessful.
Great Britain persisted. In reply to a proposal of the
British commissioners, as reported in a joint letter to
Mr. Madison, dated at London, September 11, 1806, the
plenipotentiaries declared,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That it was impossible that we should acknowledge, in
favor of any foreign power, <em>the claim to such jurisdiction on
board our vessels</em> found upon the main ocean <em>as this sort of
impressment implied</em>,&mdash;a claim as plainly inadmissible in its
principle, and derogatory from the unquestionable rights of
our sovereignty, as it was vexatious in its practical consequences.”<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In another joint letter, dated at London, November
11, 1806, the same plenipotentiaries say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The right [of the crew to protection under the flag] was
denied by the British commissioners, <em>who asserted that of
their Government to seize its subjects on board neutral merchant
vessels on the high seas</em>, and who also urged that the
relinquishment of it at this time would go far to the overthrow
of their naval power, on which the safety of the state
essentially depended.”<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Again, in letter dated at London, April 22, 1807,
Messrs. Monroe and Pinkney say of the British commissioners:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They stated that the prejudice of the navy, and of the
country generally, was so strong <em>in favor of their pretension</em>,
that the ministry could not encounter it in a direct form,
and that, in truth, the support of Parliament could not have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>been relied on in such a case.”<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The British commissioners were two excellent persons,&mdash;Lord
Holland and Lord Auckland; but, though
friendly to the United States in their declarations, and
Liberals in politics, they were powerless.</p>

<p>At home the question continued to be discussed by
able writers. Among those whose opinions were of
the highest authority was the former President, John
Adams, who, from his retirement at Quincy, sent forth
a pamphlet, dated January 9, 1809, in which the British
pretension was touched to the quick, and again was
presented the precise objection now urged by Great
Britain against the seizure of the two Rebels. Depicting
the scene, when one of our ships is boarded by a
British cruiser, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The lieutenant is to be the judge, … the midshipman
is to be clerk, and the boatswain sheriff or marshal.… It is
impossible to figure to ourselves in imagination this solemn
tribunal and venerable judge without smiling, till the humiliation
of our country comes into our thoughts and interrupts
the sense of ridicule by the tears of grief or vengeance.”<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At last all redress through negotiation was found
impossible; and this pretension, aggravated into multitudinous
tyranny, was openly announced to be one of
the principal reasons for the declaration of war against
Great Britain in 1812. In his message to Congress,
dated June 1 of that year, Mr. Madison, who was now
President, thus exposed its offensive character; and his
words, directed against a persistent practice, are now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
echoed by Great Britain in the single instance which
has accidentally occurred on our side.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Could the seizure of British subjects in such cases be
regarded as within the exercise of a belligerent right, the
acknowledged laws of war, which forbid an article of captured
property to be adjudged without a regular investigation before
a competent tribunal, <em>would imperiously demand the fairest
trial where the sacred rights of persons were at issue. In place
of such a trial, these rights are subjected to the will of every
petty commander.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

</div>

<p>While the war was waging, the subject was still discussed.
Mr. Grundy, of Tennessee, in the House of
Representatives, in a report from the Committee on
Foreign Affairs, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A subaltern or any other officer of the British navy
ought not to be arbiter in such a case. The liberty and
lives of American citizens ought not to depend on the will
of such a party.”<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such was the American ground, occupied from the beginning
without interruption, and from the beginning
most persistently contested by Great Britain.</p>

<p>The British pretension was unhesitatingly proclaimed
in the Declaration of the Prince Regent, afterwards
George the Fourth, given at the palace of Westminster,
January 9, 1813.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The President of the United States has, it is true, since
proposed to Great Britain an armistice: not, however, on the
admission that the cause of war hitherto relied on was removed,
but on condition that Great Britain, as a preliminary
step, should do away a cause of war now brought forward
<em>as such</em> for the first time,&mdash;namely, <em>that she should abandon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>the exercise of her</em> <span class="smcap">undoubted right</span> <em>of search to take from
American merchant vessels British seamen, the natural-born
subjects of His Majesty</em>.…</p>

<p>“His Royal Highness can never admit, that, in the exercise
of <em>the</em> <span class="smcap">undoubted</span> <em>and hitherto undisputed right of searching
neutral merchant vessels in time of war, the impressment of
British seamen</em>, when found therein, <em>can be deemed any violation
of a neutral flag</em>. Neither can he admit that the taking
such seamen from on board such vessels <em>can be considered by
any neutral state as a hostile measure or a justifiable cause of
war</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In the semi-official counter statement presented by
Alexander J. Dallas, at the time Secretary of the Treasury,
entitled “Exposition of the Causes and Character
of the late War,” this pretension is thus described:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But the British claim, expanding with singular elasticity,
was soon found to include <em>a right to enter American vessels
on the high seas</em>, in order to search for and seize all British
seamen; it next embraced the case of every British subject;
and finally, in its practical enforcement, it has been extended
to every mariner who could not prove upon the spot that he
was a citizen of the United States.”<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The war was closed by the Treaty at Ghent; but,
perversely, the British pretension was not renounced.
Other negotiations, in 1818 under President Monroe,
in 1823 also under Monroe, and again in 1827 under
John Quincy Adams, expressly to procure its renunciation,
were all unavailing. Of these various negotiations
I forbear all details; but the language of Mr. Rush, our
Minister at London, who pressed this question assiduously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
for several years, beginning with 1818, should not
be omitted. The case was never stated more strongly.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Let the steps by which the enforcement proceeds be
attended to. A British frigate, in time of war, meets an
American merchant vessel at sea, boards her, and, under terror
of her guns, takes out one of the crew. The boarding
lieutenant asserts, and, let it be admitted, believes, the man
to be a Briton. By this proceeding the rules observed in
deciding upon any other fact, where individual or national
rights are at stake, are overlooked. <em>The lieutenant is accuser
and judge. He decides upon his own view, instantly.</em> The impressed
man is forced into the frigate’s boat, and the case
ends. <em>There is no appeal, no trial of any kind</em>; more important
still, there is no remedy, should it appear that a wrong
has been committed.”<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At last, in 1842, at the Treaty of Washington, Mr.
Webster, calmly setting aside all idea of further negotiation
on this pretension, and without even proposing
any stipulation with regard to it, deliberately announced
the principle irrevocably adopted by our Government.
It was that announced at the beginning by Mr. Jefferson.
This document is one of the most memorable in
our history, and it bears directly on the existing controversy,
when, in exposing the British pretension, it
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“But the lieutenant of a man-of-war, having necessity for
men, <em>is apt to be a summary judge</em>, and his decisions will be
quite as significant of his own wants and his own power as
of the truth and justice of the case.”<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At a later day still, on the very eve of recent events,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>we find General Cass, as Secretary of State, in elaborate
instructions to our ministers in Europe, dated June 27,
1859, declaring principles which may properly control
the present question. He says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is obvious, from the temper of the age, that the present
is no safe time to assert and enforce pretensions on the
part of belligerent powers affecting the interest of nations at
peace, <em>unless such pretension are clearly justified by the Law
of Nations</em>.… The stopping of neutral vessels upon the
high seas, their forcible entrance, and the overhauling and
examination of their cargoes, the seizure of their freight <em>at
the will of a foreign officer</em>, the frequent interruption of their
voyages by compelling them to change their destination in
order to seek redress, and, <em>above all, the assumption of jurisdiction
by a foreign armed party over what has been aptly
termed the extension of the territory of an independent state, and
with all the abuses which are so prone to accompany the exercise
of unlimited power</em>, where responsibility is remote,&mdash;these
are, indeed, serious ‘obstructions,’ little likely to be submitted
to in the present state of the world, without a formidable
effort to prevent them.”<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such is an authentic history of this British pretension,
and of the manner in which it has been met by our
Government. And now the special argument formerly
employed by us against an intolerable pretension is invoked
by Great Britain against the error of taking two
Rebel emissaries from a British packet ship. If Captain
Wilkes is right, then, throughout all these international
debates, extending over at least two generations, have
we been wrong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>It is sometimes said, that the steam packet, having
on board the Rebel emissaries, was on this account liable
to capture, and therefore the error of Captain Wilkes
in taking the emissaries was simply of form, and not of
substance. I do not stop to consider whether an exercise
of summary power, against which our nation has so
constantly protested, can, under any circumstances, be an
error of form merely; for the national policy, most positively
declared in diplomacy, and also attested in numerous
treaties, leaves small room to doubt that a neutral
ship with enemy passengers, not in the military
or naval service, is not liable to capture, and therefore
the whole proceeding was wrong, not only because the
passengers were taken from the ship, but also because
the ship, howsoever guilty morally, was not guilty legally,
in receiving such passengers on board. If this
question were argued on English authorities, it might
be otherwise; but according to American principles, the
ship was legally innocent. Of course, I say nothing of
the moral guilt which an indignant patriotism will find
forever indelible in that ship.</p>

<p>In the middle of the last century, the Swiss publicist
Vattel declared, that, on the breaking out of war, we
are no longer under obligation to leave the enemy in
free enjoyment of his rights; and this principle he applied
loosely to the transit of ambassadors.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Sir William
Scott, afterwards known in the English peerage as Lord
Stowell, quoting this authority, at the beginning of the
present century, let fall these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You may stop the ambassador of your enemy on his passage.”<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And this curt proposition, though in some respects indefinite,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>has been often since repeated by writers on the
Law of Nations. On its face it leaves the question unsettled,
whether the emissaries of an unrecognized Government
can be stopped. But there is another case in
which the same British judge, who has done so much
to illustrate International Law, has used language which
seems to embrace not only authentic ambassadors, but
also pretenders to this character, and all others who are
public agents of the enemy. Says this eminent magistrate:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It appears to me on <em>principle</em> to be but reasonable, that,
whenever it is of sufficient importance to the enemy that
<em>such persons should be sent out on the public service, at the
public expense</em>, it should afford equal ground of forfeiture
against the vessel that may be let out for a purpose so intimately
connected with the hostile operations.”<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Admit that the emissaries of an unrecognized Government
cannot be recognized as ambassadors, with the
liabilities as well as immunities of this character, yet,
in the face of these words, it is difficult to see how a
Government bowing habitually to the authority of Sir
William Scott, and regarding our Rebels as “belligerents,”
can assert that a steam packet, conveying emissaries
from these belligerents, “sent out on the public service,
at the public expense,” was, according to the language
of Earl Russell, “pursuing a lawful and innocent
voyage.” At least, in this assertion, the British Government
seems to turn its back again upon its own history,
or it sets aside the facts so openly boasted with
regard to the public character of these fugitives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>On this question British policy may change with
circumstances, and British precedents may be uncertain,
but the original American policy is unchangeable,
and the American precedents which illustrate it are
solemn treaties. The words of Vattel and the judgments
of Sir William Scott were well known to the
statesmen of the United States; and yet, in the face of
these authorities, which have entered so largely into
this debate, the National Government at an early day
deliberately adopted a contrary policy, to which for half
a century there was steady adherence. It was plainly
declared <em>that only soldiers or officers could be stopped</em>,
thus positively excluding the idea of stopping ambassadors,
or emissaries of any kind, not in the military or
naval service. Mr. Madison, who more than any other
person shaped our national policy on Maritime Rights,
has stated it on this question. In his remarkable despatch
to Mr. Monroe, at London, dated January 5, 1804,
he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The article renounces the claim to take from the vessels
of the neutral party, on the high seas, any person whatever
<em>not in the military service of an enemy</em>, an exception which we
admit to come within the Law of Nations, on the subject of
contraband of war. <em>With this exception, we consider a neutral
flag on the high seas as a safeguard to those sailing under
it.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then again, in the same despatch, this statesman
says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Great Britain must produce, then, an exception in the
Law of Nations in favor of the right she contends for. But
in what written and received authority will she find it? In
what usage, except her own, will it be found?… But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>nowhere will she find an exception to this freedom of the
seas, and of neutral flags, which justifies the taking away of
any person, <em>not an enemy in military service</em>, found on board
a neutral vessel.”<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And once more, in the same despatch, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Whenever a belligerent claim against persons on board
a neutral vessel is referred to in treaties, <em>enemies in military
service alone</em> are excepted from the general immunity of persons
in that situation; <em>and this exception confirms the immunity
of those who are not included in it</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In pursuance of this principle, thus clearly announced
and repeated, Mr. Madison instructed Mr. Monroe to
propose a convention between the United States and
Great Britain containing the following stipulation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“No person whatever shall, upon the high seas and without
the jurisdiction of either party, be demanded or taken
out of any ship or vessel belonging to citizens or subjects of
one of the parties, by the public or private armed ships belonging
to or in the service of the other, <em>unless such person
be at the time in the military service of an enemy of such other
party</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Monroe pressed this stipulation most earnestly
upon the British Government; but, though treated courteously,
he could get no satisfaction. Lord Harrowby,
the Foreign Secretary, in one of his conversations, “expressed
concern to find the United States opposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Great Britain on certain great neutral questions, in
favor of the doctrines of the Modern Law, which he
termed <em>novelties</em>”;<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and Lord Mulgrave, who succeeded
this accomplished nobleman, persevered in the same
dissent. Mr. Monroe writes, under date of 18th October,
1805:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“On a review of the conduct of this Government towards
the United States from the commencement of the war, I am
inclined to think that the delay which has been so studiously
sought in all these concerns is the part of a system,
and that it is intended, as circumstances favor, to subject
our commerce, at present and hereafter, to every restraint in
their power.”<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Afterwards Mr. Monroe was joined in the mission to
London, as we have already seen, by Mr. Pinkney, and
the two united in again presenting this same proposition
to the British Government.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> It was rejected, although
the ministry of Mr. Fox, who was then in power,
seems to have afforded at one time the expectation of
an agreement.</p>

<p>While these distinguished plenipotentiaries were pressing
this principle at London, Mr. Madison was maintaining
it at home. In an unpublished communication to
Mr. Merry, the British minister at Washington, bearing
date 9th April, 1805, which I extract from the files of
the State Department, he declared:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The United States cannot accede to the claim of any
nation to take from their vessels on the high seas <em>any description
of persons, except soldiers</em> in the actual service of the
enemy.”<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In a reply bearing date 12th April, 1805, this principle
was positively repudiated by the British minister;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
so that the two Governments were ranged unequivocally
on opposite sides. And this attitude was continued.
In the subsequent negotiations at London, intrusted
to Mr. Rush, in 1818, we find the two powers
face to face. The Foreign Secretary was the celebrated
Lord Castlereagh, who, according to Mr. Rush,
did not hesitate to complain,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That we gave to our ships a character of inviolability
that Britain did not: that we considered them as part of
our soil, clothing them with like immunities.”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">To which Mr. Rush replied:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That we did consider them as thus inviolable, so far as
to afford protection to our seamen; but that we had never
sought to exempt them from search for rightful purposes,
viz., for enemy’s property, articles contraband of war, or
<em>men in the land or naval service of the enemy. These constituted
the utmost limit of the belligerent claim, as we understood
the Law of Nations.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Two champions were never more completely opposed
than were the two Governments on this question.</p>

<p>The treaties of the United States with foreign nations
are in harmony with the principle so energetically proposed
and upheld,&mdash;beginning with the Treaty of Amity
and Commerce with France in 1778, and ending
only with the Peruvian treaty as late as 1851. Here
is the provision in the treaty with France, negotiated
by Franklin, whose wise forethought is always conspicuous:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“And it is hereby stipulated that free ships shall also
give a freedom to goods, and that everything shall be
deemed to be free and exempt which shall be found on
board the ships belonging to the subjects of either of the
confederates, although the whole lading or any part thereof
should appertain to the enemies of either, contraband goods
being always excepted. It is also agreed, in like manner,
that the same liberty be extended to persons who are on
board a free ship, with this effect, that, <em>although they be enemies
to both or either party, they are not to be taken out of that
free ship, unless they are soldiers and in actual service of the
enemies</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The obvious effect of this stipulation is twofold: first,
that enemies, unless soldiers in actual service, shall not
be taken out of a neutral ship; and, secondly, that such
persons are not contraband of war so as to affect the
voyage of a neutral with illegality. Such was the
proposition of Franklin, of whom it has been said, that
he snatched the lightning from the skies, and the sceptre
from tyrants. That he sought to snatch the trident
also is attested by his whole diplomacy, of which this
proposition is part.</p>

<p>But the same principle is found in succeeding treaties,
sometimes with a slight change of language. In
the treaty with the Netherlands, negotiated by John
Adams in 1782, the exception is confined to “military
men actually in the service of an enemy,”<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>; and this
same exception is also found in the treaty with Sweden
in 1783,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> with Prussia in 1785,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> with Spain in
1795,<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> with France in 1800,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> with Colombia in 1824,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
with Central America in 1825,<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> with Brazil in 1828,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>]</a>

treaty with Peru in 1851.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Such is unbroken testimony, in the most solemn
form, to the policy of our Government. In some of
the treaties the exception is simply “soldiers,” in others
it is “officers or soldiers.” Observe, too, that every
treaty testifies to the opinions of the Administration
that negotiated it, and of at least two thirds of the
Senate that ratified it,&mdash;so that this large number of
treaties constitutes a mass of authority from which
there can be no appeal, embracing all the great names
of our history. It is true that among these treaties
there is none with Great Britain; but it is also true
that this is simply because our mother country refused
assent, when this principle was presented as an undoubted
part of International Law which our Government
desired to confirm by treaty.</p>

<p>Clearly and beyond all question, according to American
principle and practice, the ship was not liable to
capture on account of the presence of emissaries, “not
soldiers or officers”; nor could such emissaries be legally
taken from the ship. But the completeness of this
authority is increased by the concurring testimony of
the Continent of Europe. Since the Peace of Utrecht,
in 1713, the policy of the Continental States has generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
refused to sanction the removal of enemies from
a neutral ship, unless military men in actual service.
And now, since this debate has commenced, we have
the positive testimony of the French Government to
the same principle, given with special reference to the
present case. M. Thouvenel, the Minister of the Emperor
for Foreign Affairs, in a recent letter communicated
to Mr. Seward, and published with the papers
before the Senate, earnestly insists that the Rebel
emissaries, not being military persons actually in the
service of the enemy, were not subject to seizure on
board a neutral ship.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>I leave this question with the remark, that it is perhaps
Great Britain alone whose position here can be
brought into doubt. Originally a party to the Treaty
of Utrecht, this imperial power soon saw that its provisions
in favor of Maritime Rights interfered plainly
with that dictatorship of the sea which Britannia was
then grasping. Maritime Rights were repudiated, and
her Admiralty Courts have ever since enforced this
repudiation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Still another question occurs. Beyond all doubt
there were “despatches” on board the ship,&mdash;such
“despatches” as rebels can write. Public report, the
statement of persons on board, and the boastful declaration
of Jefferson Davis in an official document that
these emissaries were proceeding under appointment
from him, which appointment would be a “despatch”
of the highest character,&mdash;and necessarily with instructions
also, being another “despatch,”&mdash;seem to place
this beyond denial. Assuming such fact, very notorious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
at the time of sailing, the ship was liable to capture
and to be carried off for adjudication, according to
British authorities,&mdash;unless the positive judgment of
Sir William Scott in the case of the Atalanta,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> and also
the Queen’s Proclamation at the commencement of the
Rebellion, enumerating “despatches” among contraband
articles, are treated as nullities, or so far modified in
application as to be words and nothing more. Even
if the judgment be uncertain and inapplicable, the
Queen’s Proclamation is not. Does it not warn British
subjects against “carrying officers, soldiers, <em>despatches</em>,
arms, military stores or materials, … <em>for the use or
service</em> of either of the said contending parties”? And
we have the authority of a recent English writer,
quoted by the English press, who characterizes the conveyance
of despatches as “a <em>service</em>, which, in whatever
degree it exists, can only be considered in one character,
as an act of the most noxious and hostile nature.”<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>But however binding and peremptory these authorities
in Great Britain, they cannot be accepted to reverse
a standing policy of the United States. For the
sake of precision in rights claimed and accorded on the
ocean, our Government has explained in treaties what
was meant by contraband. As early as 1778, in the
treaty with France negotiated by Franklin, after specifying
contraband articles, without including despatches,
it is declared that</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Free goods are all other merchandises and <em>things</em> which
are not comprehended and particularly mentioned in the
foregoing enumeration of contraband goods.”<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This was before the judgment of Sir William Scott,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>recognizing despatches as contraband; but in other
treaties subsequent to this well-known judgment, and
therefore practically discarding it, after enumerating
contraband articles, without specifying “despatches,”
the following provision is introduced:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All other merchandises and <em>things</em> not comprehended in
the articles of contraband explicitly enumerated and classified
as above shall be held and considered as free.”<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then again John Quincy Adams, in his admirable
draught of a treaty for the reform of Maritime Rights,
after declaring specifically what shall be “under the
denomination of contraband of war,” without including
“despatches,” adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All the above articles, <em>and none others</em>, shall be subject
to confiscation, whenever they are attempted to be carried to
an enemy.”<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus we have not only words of enumeration without
mention of “despatches,” but also words of exception.
These testimonies constitute the record of our nation
on this question.</p>

<p>Here it may be remarked, that, while decisions of
British Admiralty Courts are freely cited, there are
none of our Supreme Court. If any existed, they
would be of the highest value; but there are none,
and I can imagine no better reason than because the
question is so settled by treaties and diplomacy as to
be beyond judicial inquiry.</p>

<p>The conclusion follows, that, according to American
principle and practice, the ship was not liable on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
of despatches on board. And here again we have the
testimony of Continental Europe, if we may accept the
statement of Hautefeuille, and it would seem also that
of the French Government, in the recent letter of M.
Thouvenel.</p>

<p>The French champion of neutral rights vindicates the
immunity of despatches against English construction in
pointed language.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We must be permitted to protest against the pretension
set up by the Americans of considering the transportation
of despatches as an act of contraband, and consequently of
maintaining that the stopping of the Trent is justified by
the fact that there were found on board despatches of the
Confederate Government. This pretension, which has always
been maintained by England, and which even at the
present day is still avowed by its journals, is wholly contrary
to all the principles of International Law.”<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But Continental testimony is not uniform. So considerable
an authority as Heffter recognizes the liability
of a neutral vessel for “<em>voluntarily</em> forwarding
despatches to or for a belligerent.”<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> This is on general
grounds, independent of treaty or national usage.</p>

<p>Even if the ship were liable, so that Captain Wilkes
would have been justified in bringing the Trent into
port for adjudication, it does not follow that the two
Rebels could be summarily seized and taken therefrom.
Here again we are brought to that American
principle which condemns the pretension of seizing
even enemies on board a neutral vessel, unless they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
are soldiers in actual service, and has constantly cried
out against the desecration of our decks by British officers
seizing our peaceful sailors under claim of allegiance
to the British crown.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is yet another question which remains. Assuming
that despatches are contraband, would their
presence on board a neutral ship, sailing between two
neutral ports, render the voyage illegal? The mail
steamer was sailing between Havana, a port of Spain,
and St. Thomas, a port of Denmark. Here again, if
we bow to English precedent, the answer is prompt.
The British oracle has spoken. In a well-considered
judgment, Sir William Scott declares that despatches
taken on board a neutral ship, sailing from a neutral
country and bound for another neutral country, are contraband,&mdash;but
that, where there is reason to believe the
master ignorant of their character, “it is not a case in
which the property is to be confiscated, although in this,
<em>as in every other instance in which the enemy’s despatches
are found on board a vessel</em>, he has justly subjected himself
to all the inconveniences of seizure and detention,
and to all the expenses of those judicial inquiries which
they have occasioned.”<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Such is the Law of Nations
according to Great Britain.</p>

<p>Even if this rule had not been positively repudiated
by the United States, it is so inconsistent with reason,
and, in the present condition of maritime commerce, so
utterly impracticable, that it can find little favor. If a
neutral voyage between two neutral ports is rendered
illegal on this account, then the postal facilities of the
world, and the costly enterprises by which they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
conducted, are exposed to interruptions under which
they must at times be crushed, to the infinite detriment
of universal commerce. If the rule is applicable in one
sea, it is applicable in all seas, and there is no part of
the ocean which may not be vexed by its enforcement.
It would reach to the Mediterranean and to the distant
China seas as easily as to the Bahama Channel, and
be equally imperative in the chops of the British Channel.
Not only the stately mail steamers traversing
the ocean would be subject to detention and possible
confiscation, but the same penalties must attach to the
daily packets between Dover and Calais. The simple
statement of such a consequence, following directly from
the British rule, throws instant doubt over it, which the
eloquent judgment of Sir William Scott cannot remove.</p>

<p>Here again our way is clear. American principle
and practice have settled this question also. Wheaton
commences his statement of the Law of Contraband by
saying, “The general freedom of neutral commerce with
the respective belligerent powers is subject to some exceptions.
<em>Among these is the trade with the enemy</em> in
certain articles called contraband of war.”<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> It will be
perceived that the trade must be <em>with the enemy</em>, not
with the neutral. And here the author followed the
suggestions of reason and the voice of American treaties.
In the celebrated treaty with Great Britain negotiated
by John Jay in 1794, after an enumeration of
contraband articles, it is expressly said, “And all the
above articles are hereby declared to be just objects
of confiscation, <em>whenever they are attempted to be carried
to an enemy</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> Of course, when on the way to neutrals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>,
they are free. And the early treaties negotiated
by Benjamin Franklin and John Adams are in similar
spirit; and in precisely the same sense is the treaty
with Prussia in 1828, which in its twelfth article revives
the thirteenth article of our treaty with that same
power in 1799, by which contraband is declared to be
detainable <em>only when carried to an enemy</em>. Even if this
rule were of doubtful authority with regard to articles
of acknowledged contraband, it is positive with regard
to despatches, which, as we have already seen, are
among “merchandises and <em>things</em>” declared free; with
regard to which our early treaties secured the greatest
latitude. Nothing can be broader than the words in
the treaty of 1778 with France:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“So that they may be transported and carried <em>in the freest
manner</em> by the subjects of both confederates, even to places
belonging to an enemy, such towns or places being only
excepted as are at that time besieged, blocked up, or invested.”<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">But the provision in the treaty with the Netherlands of
1782 is equally broad:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“So that all <em>effects</em> and merchandises which are not expressly
before named may, <em>without any exception and in perfect
liberty</em>, be transported by the subjects and inhabitants
of both allies from and to places belonging to the enemy,
excepting only the places which at the same time shall be
besieged, blocked, or invested; and those places only shall
be held for such which are surrounded nearly by some of
the belligerent powers.”<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

</div>

<p>If the immunity of neutral ships needed further confirmation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>it would be found again in the concurring testimony
of the French Government, conveyed in the recent
letter of M. Thouvenel,<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>&mdash;which is so remarkable
for its brief, but comprehensive, treatment of the questions
involved in this controversy. I know not how
others may feel, but I like to believe that this communication,
when rightly understood, may be accepted as
a token of friendship for us, and also as a contribution
to those Maritime Rights for which France and the United
States in times past have done so much together.
This eminent minister does not hesitate to declare, that,
if the flag of a neutral cannot completely cover persons
and merchandise in a voyage between two neutral ports,
then its immunity will be but a vain word.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As I conclude what I have to say on contraband in
its several divisions, I venture to assert that there are
two rules in regard to it which the traditional policy of
our country has constantly declared, and has embodied
in treaty stipulations with every power that could be
persuaded to adopt them: first, that no article is contraband,
unless expressly enumerated and specified as
such by name; secondly, that, when such articles, so
enumerated and specified, are found by the belligerent
on board a neutral ship, the neutral shall be permitted
to deliver them to the belligerent, whenever, by reason
of bulk or quantity, such delivery is possible, and then
the neutral shall, without further molestation, proceed
with all remaining innocent cargo to his destination, being
any port, neutral or hostile, not at the time actually
blockaded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the early fixed policy of our country with
regard to contraband in neutral bottoms. It is recorded
in several of our earlier European treaties. Approximation
to it is found in other European treaties, showing
our constant effort in this direction. But this policy
was not supported by the British theory and practice of
International Law, especially active during the wars of
the French Revolution; and to this fact may be ascribed
something of the difficulty which our Government
encountered in effort to secure for this liberal
policy the complete sanction of European nations. But
in negotiations with the Spanish-American States the
theory and practice of Great Britain were less felt; and
so to-day that liberal policy, embracing the two rules
touching contraband, is, among all American nations,
the public law, stipulated and fixed in solemn treaties.
I do not quote texts, but I refer to all these treaties,
beginning with the convention between the United
States and Colombia in 1824. These rules, if not directly
conclusive on the question of contraband, at least
help to exhibit that spirit of emancipation with which
our country has approached the great subject of Maritime
Rights.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of course this discussion proceeds on the assumption
that the Rebels are regarded as belligerents, which is the
character especially accorded by Great Britain. If they
are not regarded as belligerents, then is the proceeding
of Captain Wilkes indubitably illegal and void. To a
political offender, however deep his guilt, though burdened
with the undying execrations of all honest men,
and bending beneath the consciousness of the ruin he
has brought upon his country, the asylum of a foreign
jurisdiction is sacred, whether on shore or sea; and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>it is
among the proudest boasts of England, at least in recent
days, that the exiles of defeated democracies, as well as
of defeated dynasties, have found a sure protection beneath
her meteor flag. And yet this lofty power has
not always accorded to other flags what she claimed for
her own. One of the objections made to any renunciation
of impressment by Great Britain, at the beginning
of the present century, was, “that facility would be
given, particularly in the British Channel, by the immunity
claimed for American vessels, <em>to the escape of
traitors</em>”<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>: thus assuming, not only that traitors&mdash;companions
of Robert Emmet, in Ireland, or companions of
Horne Tooke, in England&mdash;ought to be arrested on
board a neutral ship, but that impressment was needed
for this purpose. This flagrant instance cannot be a precedent
for the United States, which has maintained the
right of asylum as firmly always as it has rejected the
pretension of impressment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If I am correct in this review, then the conclusion is
inevitable. The seizure of the Rebel emissaries on board
a neutral ship cannot be justified, according to declared
American principles and practice. There is no single
point where the seizure is not questionable, unless we
invoke British precedents and practice, which, beyond
doubt, led Captain Wilkes into his mistake. In the
solitude of his ship he consulted familiar authorities
at hand, and felt that in Vattel and Sir William Scott,
as quoted by eminent writers, he had guides, while the
inveterate practice of the British navy lighted his way.
He was mistaken. There was a better example: it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the constant, uniform, unhesitating practice of his own
country on the ocean, conceding always the greatest
immunities to neutral ships, unless sailing to blockaded
ports, refusing to consider despatches as contraband
of war, refusing to consider persons other than
soldiers or officers as contraband of war, and protesting
always against an adjudication of personal rights
by summary judgment of the quarter-deck. Had these
well-attested precedents been in his mind, the gallant
captain would not, even for a moment, have been seduced
from allegiance to those principles which constitute
part of our country’s glory.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. President, let the Rebels go. Two wicked men,
ungrateful to their country, with two younger confederates,
are set loose with the brand of Cain upon their
foreheads. Prison-doors are opened; but principles are
established which will help to free other men, and to
open the gates of the sea. Never before in her renowned
history has Great Britain ranged herself on this
side. Such an event is an epoch. “<i>Novus sæclôrum nascitur
ordo.</i>” To the liberties of the sea this power is at
last committed. To a certain extent the great cause is
now under her tutelary care. If the immunities of passengers
not in the military or naval service, as well as of
sailors, are not directly recognized, they are at least implied;
if neutral rights are not ostentatiously proclaimed,
they are at least invoked; while the whole pretension of
impressment, so long the pest of neutral commerce, and
operating only through lawless adjudication of the quarter-deck,
is made absolutely impossible. Thus is the
freedom of the sea enlarged in the name of peaceful
neutral rights, not only by limiting the number of persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
exposed to the penalties of war, but by driving from
it the most offensive pretension that ever stalked upon
its waves. Farewell to kidnapping and man-stealing on
the ocean! To such conclusion Great Britain is irrevocably
pledged. Nor treaty nor bond is needed. It is
sufficient that her late appeal can be vindicated only by
renunciation of early, long-continued tyranny. Let her
bear the Rebels back. The consideration is ample; for
the sea became free as this altered power went forth, steering
westward with the sun, on an errand of liberation.</p>

<p>In this surrender, if such it may be called, the National
Government does not even “stoop to conquer.”
It simply lifts itself to the height of its own original
principles. The early efforts of its best negotiators, the
patriot trials of its soldiers in an unequal war, at length
prevail, and Great Britain, usually so haughty, invites
us to practise upon principles which she has so strenuously
opposed. There are victories of force: here is
a victory of truth. If Great Britain has gained the
custody of two Rebels, the United States have secured
the triumph of their principles.</p>

<p>As this result is in conformity with our cherished
history, it is superfluous to add other considerations;
and yet I venture to suggest that estranged sympathies
abroad may be secured again by open adhesion
to principles which have the support already of Continental
Europe, smarting for years under British pretensions.
The powerful organs of opinion on the Continent
are also with us. Hautefeuille, whose earnest
work on the Law of Nations<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> is the arsenal of neutral
rights, has entered into this debate with a direct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
proposition for the release of the emissaries, as a testimony
to the true interpretation of International Law.
Another distinguished Frenchman, Agénor de Gasparin,
whose impassioned love of liberty and enlightened
devotion to our country impart to his voice all
the persuasion of friendship, has made a similar appeal.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
And a journal which of itself is an authority, the <i>Revue
des Deux Mondes</i>, declares, in words which harmonize
with what I have said to-day, that, “in disavowing a
capture effected by the arbitrary initiative of a naval
officer, without any of the guaranties of legal justice,
without the intervention and the sanction of a Court
of Admiralty, the United States, far from renouncing
any of their political principles, would only render homage
to the doctrine which they have ever professed
on the rights of neutrals.” The same distinguished
journal proceeds: “It would be in reality a true triumph
for this doctrine so to apply it to the profit of a
nation and of a government which have always contested
or violated the rights of neutrals, but which
would be henceforward constrained to the abandonment
of their arbitrary pretensions by the conspicuous authority
of such a precedent.”<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>Nor is this triumph enough. The sea-god will in
future use his trident less; but the same principles
which led to the present renunciation of early pretensions
naturally conduct to yet further emancipation of
the sea. The work of maritime civilization is not finished.
And here the two nations, equally endowed by
commerce, and matched together, while surpassing all
others, in peaceful ships, may gloriously unite in setting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
up new pillars, to mark new triumphs, rendering the
ocean a highway of peace, instead of a bloody field.</p>

<p>The Congress of Paris, in 1856, where were assembled
the plenipotentiaries of Great Britain, France, Austria,
Prussia, Russia, Sardinia, and Turkey, has already
led the way. Adopting the early policy of the United
States, often proposed to foreign nations, this congress
authenticated two important changes in restraint of
belligerent rights: first, that the neutral flag shall protect
enemy goods, except contraband of war; and, secondly,
that neutral goods, except contraband of war, are
not liable to capture under an enemy’s flag. This is
much. Another proposition, for the abolition of Privateering,
was defective in two respects: first, because
it left nations free to employ private vessels under public
commission as ships of the navy, and therefore was
nugatory; and, secondly, because, if not nugatory, it
was too obviously in the special interest of Great
Britain, which, through her commanding navy, would
be left at will to rule the sea. No change can be practicable
which is not equal in advantage to all nations;
for the Equality of Nations is not a dry dogma merely
of International Law, but a vital sentiment common to
all. This cannot be overlooked; and every proposition
must be brought sincerely to its equitable test.</p>

<p>There is a way in which privateering may be effectively
abolished without shock to the Equality of Nations.
A simple proposition, assuring private property
on the ocean the same immunity it now enjoys on
land, will at once abolish privateering, and relieve commerce
on the ocean from its greatest perils, so that,
like commerce on land, it will be undisturbed, except
by illegal robbery and theft. Such a proposition must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
operate for the equal advantage of all. On this account,
and in the policy of peace, always cultivated by our
Republic, it has been already presented to other nations.
You have not forgotten the important paper in
which Mr. Marcy did this service,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> and the favor it
found with European powers, always excepting Great
Britain, whose opposition was too potential. But this
vast cause was never commended with more force than
by John Quincy Adams, as Secretary of State, when,
in a masterly despatch, he declared that “private war,
banished by the tacit and general consent of Christian
nations from their territories, has taken its last refuge
upon the ocean, and there continues to disgrace and
afflict them by a system of licensed robbery, bearing
all the most atrocious characters of piracy.”<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> The
Governments of Europe were invited to enter into conventions
by which “all warfare against private property
upon the sea is disclaimed and renounced,” and at the
same time the final suppression of the slave-trade assured,
so that the freedom of the sea was associated
with the freedom of men.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> In the same humane interest,
Henry Clay, as Secretary of State, invited Great
Britain “to agree to the abolition of privateering, and
no longer to consider private property on the high seas
as lawful prize of war.”<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> In such a cause the effort
alone was noble.</p>

<p>To complete the efficacy of this reform, closing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>gate against belligerent pretensions, Contraband of War
should be abolished, so that all ships may navigate the
ocean freely, without peril or detention from the character
of persons or things on board: and here I only follow
the Administration of Washington, enjoining upon
John Jay, in his negotiation with England, to seek security
for neutral commerce, particularly “by abolishing
contraband <em>altogether</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> The Right of Search, which, on
outbreak of war, becomes an omnipresent tyranny, subjecting
every neutral ship to the arbitrary invasion of
every belligerent cruiser, would then disappear. It
would drop, as the chains from an emancipated slave;
or rather, it would exist only as an occasional agent,
under solemn treaties, in the war waged by civilization
against the slave-trade; and then it would be proudly
recognized as an honorable surrender to the best interests
of humanity, glorifying the flag which made it.</p>

<p>With the consummation of these reforms in Maritime
Law, war will be despoiled of its most vexatious prerogatives,
while innocent neutrals are exempt from its
torments. One step further is needed to complete this
exemption. Commercial Blockade must be abandoned;
for, while its first effects are naturally felt by the belligerent
against whom directed, it soon acts with kindred
hardship upon all neutrals, near or remote, whose
customary commerce is interrupted,&mdash;so that the blockade
of an American port may cause distress in Liverpool
and Manchester, in Lyons and Marseilles, scarcely
less than if these great cities were under pressure of
a blockading squadron. Neutrals, it is said, must not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
relieve belligerents, and therefore blockade is effectively
a two-edged sword, wounding belligerents on the
one side and neutrals on the other side,&mdash;often, indeed,
wounding neutrals as much as belligerents. If
not designedly so, it becomes thus mischievous from
the essential vice of its character. Blockade may be
called the elephant of naval warfare, as destructive,
often, to friends as to foes. So palpable is this becoming,
that it is doubtful if neutrals will much longer
allow such backhanded agency, smiting the innocent
as well as the guilty, to continue under sanction of
International Law. Its extinction is needed to complete
the triumph of Neutral Rights.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>Such a change, just in proportion to its accomplishment,
will be a blessing to mankind, inconceivable in
grandeur. The statutes of the sea, thus refined and elevated,
will be agents of peace instead of agents of war.
Ships and cargoes will pass unchallenged from shore to
shore, and those terrible belligerent rights under which
the commerce of the world has so long suffered will
cease from troubling. In this work our country began
early. Hardly had we proclaimed our own independence,
before we sought to secure a similar independence
for the sea. Hardly had we made a constitution
for our own government, before we sought to establish
a constitution similar in spirit for the government of
the sea. If not prevailing promptly, it was because
we could not overcome the unyielding resistance of
Great Britain. And now, behold, this champion of
belligerent rights has “changed his hand and checked
his pride.” Welcome to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> the new-found alliance!
Welcome to the peaceful transfiguration! Meanwhile,
through all present excitements, amidst all trials, beneath
all threatening clouds, it only remains for us
to uphold the perpetual policy of the Republic, and
to stand fast on the ancient ways.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The reception of this speech revealed the interest of the question,
which was not inferior to that of Slavery. The auditory at its delivery,
the expressions of the public press, the sensation in England,
and letters from all quarters were as instructive as complimentary.
Among our own countrymen at home and abroad the satisfaction was
general. The people were against war with England, and they were
glad to learn that by surrender of the Rebels Maritime Rights had
obtained new safeguard, while the British pretext for war was removed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The scene at the delivery was described by the leading journals.</p>

<p>The correspondent of the <i>New York Tribune</i> telegraphed briefly, but
emphatically.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Senator Sumner’s speech was felt to be exhaustive of the Law of Nations
which governed the case of the Trent, and is already ranked in Washington
as a state paper upon the question of seizure and search worthy to be
placed side by side with the despatches of Madison and Jefferson. It was
delivered to a thronged and charmed Senate.”</p>

</div>

<p>The correspondent of the <i>New York Herald</i> telegraphed more at
length.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The speech was impressively delivered. The galleries of the Senate
were densely crowded. Notwithstanding the inclemency of the weather,
the ladies’ gallery was filled to overflowing. Mrs. Vice-President Hamlin
and a party of her friends occupied seats in the diplomatic gallery, which
was also filled. Secretaries Chase and Cameron occupied seats on the floor
of the Chamber, where were also the French, Russian, Austrian, Prussian,
Danish, and Swedish ministers. Lord Lyons was not present, as etiquette
required that he should not be there on such an occasion. The speech was
listened to with fixed attention by Senators Bright and Powell and ex-Senator
Green. M. Mercier, the French minister, occupied a seat next to
Mr. Bright, and exchanged salutations with Mr. Sumner at the conclusion
of the speech, as did also most of the other foreign dignitaries.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sumner’s speech has created a marked impression on the public in
regard to himself. It has removed much prejudice that existed against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>him, and added greatly to his reputation as a profound statesman. The impression
prevailed, that, with all his learning, his extraordinary acquirements,
and splendid talents, he could not avoid the introduction of his
peculiar views in reference to Slavery; and on account of the strong Antislavery
proclivities of England hitherto, and the sympathy heretofore from
this cause existing between leading English politicians and our own Antislavery
men of Mr. Sumner’s class, it was apprehended by many that he
would be inclined to lean towards Great Britain in this controversy. His
course to-day was, therefore, an agreeable surprise. The absence of any
allusion in his speech to the Negro Question demonstrated his ability and
willingness to rise superior to the one idea attributed to him, and the
scathing exposition of British inconsistency in regard to the right of search,
and the dignified rebuke he administered to England, exhibited his capacity
to regard public affairs with the eye of a genuine statesman.</p>

<p>“The applause accorded to this really great production is universal and
unqualified.”</p>

</div>

<p>The correspondent of the <i>New York Evening Post</i> gives the following
sketch of the scene in a letter.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In spite of the fog, rain, and mud of this morning, the galleries of the
Senate Chamber began to fill at an early hour. In addition to the lounging
<i>habitués</i> of the daily sessions, came a crowd which left them no room to
lounge. You have only to advertise a speech, and how the life-tide sets
towards the Capitol! Mr. Sumner’s splendid oratory always attracts immense
audiences, even when his speeches bear upon the unpopular subject
of Slavery.</p>

<p>“Most people seemed to think that he was the slave of this one idea,
and could only be great when mounted on his hobby. But in his master
speech on the Trent affair and its relation to Maritime and International
Law he has proved himself to be something more than the accomplished
scholar, the eloquent speech-maker, forcing the recognition of his statesmanship
from the very mouths of his enemies. This exposition of the triumph
of American principles, necessarily less ornate than his more literary
productions, is marked by all his usual fastidious strength of style. Vibrating
through his voice, every word seemed a live nerve quivering with electric
meaning.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>

<p>“A speech so kind and calm in rebuke, so elaborate in research, so bountiful
in proof, so conclusive in argument, coming from the Chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Relations, and an acknowledged favorite of England,
will appeal with strong conviction to her people. Here in Washington its
praise is on every tongue. In the dense crowd of the gallery General Fremont
was conspicuous, and among the Abolitionists of the audience were the
Rev. John Pierpont and Rev. Dr. Channing of the new Antislavery church.
The French, Danish, Prussian, Austrian, Russian, and Spanish ministers,
with Secretaries Chase and Cameron, sat in groups in the Senate Chamber,
amid the eagerly listening Senators. The last is a special item; for I observe,
as an every-day habit, that these distinguished gentlemen do not pay
very marked attention to each other’s speeches. In the crimson diplomatic
gallery sat the daughter and wife of Vice-President Hamlin.”</p>

</div>

<p>The editorial judgments were in harmony with the reports of correspondents.</p>

<p>The <i>National Intelligencer</i>, at Washington, which had not inclined to
Mr. Sumner on Slavery, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We give to-day, in consideration of the current interest attaching to its
subject, and, we may add, because of its great ability, the speech delivered
yesterday by Mr. Sumner in the Senate of the United States on the question
of International Law raised by the arrest of Messrs. Mason and Slidell.</p>

<p>“Singularly qualified for this discussion by his erudition as a jurist and
as a student of history, besides being called by his position as Chairman of
the Committee on Foreign Relations in the Senate to give to the subject that
mature consideration it deserves, Mr. Sumner has brought to its treatment
an affluence of illustration and authority, derived from the most cherished
traditions of American diplomacy, for the purpose of showing that the decision
to which our Government has come in the premises may be rested on
a broader foundation than that which was sufficient to cover the ground of
the British reclamation against the act of Captain Wilkes.”</p>

</div>

<p><i>L’Eco d’Italia</i>, an Italian paper in New York, took this occasion to
pay a warm tribute to Mr. Sumner, and his moderation of conduct.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Nobody had better right to speak with knowledge and authority than
the Chairman of the Committee of Foreign Relations, and as a man rather
extreme in his ideas of personal independence.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then complimenting him on his knowledge of French and Italian,
his admiration of Italian literature, and his ardent love of Italy, this
journal says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Sumner, from the beginning of his political career, showed himself the
decided enemy of Slavery, and was marked by the opposite party as an
Abolitionist, which was equivalent to subverter of public order, robber, and
worse. In the midst of the greatest difficulties he kept himself constant
always.… Now that the movement has commenced, Sumner, instead
of throwing wood on the fire, which already burns too much, shows all the
prudence and sagacity of a true statesman.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>World</i>, in New York, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The carefully prepared speech which Mr. Sumner delivered in the Senate
yesterday is an important contribution to the stock of current information
on an important question of public law. The arrest of Mason and Slidell
has not before been discussed with so much breadth of research. Mr.
Sumner’s luminous speech is a remarkable example of the advantage of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>historical knowledge in the discussion of public questions.…</p>

<p>“It is creditable to Mr. Sumner that he has been able to present so conclusive
an historical argument in opposition to the view of this subject
taken by legists and publicists so able and erudite as Mr. Everett, Mr.
Cushing, Professor Parsons, and Chief-Justice Bigelow, of his own State,
and most of the public journals in all parts of the country. The error of
these writers has consisted in an undue deference to the British admiralty
decisions,&mdash;decisions against whose validity on the points involved in this
controversy our Government has always protested.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sumner’s argument plainly sustains Mr. Seward in his surrender of
the Rebel commissioners, but not in his delaying to do so till they were demanded
by the English Government. The thanks of the country are due to
Mr. Sumner for his convincing argument that the national honor has suffered
no detriment by their surrender.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>New York Commercial Advertiser</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Mr. Sumner gives, within limits as brief as the nature of the case would
permit, the arguments which influenced the Committee after a laborious investigation
of the point in dispute. He performs this duty in a temperate,
lucid, and convincing manner, rising above all asperity or excitement, and
viewing the question as it affects the best interests of the human race. At
the same time he has steered almost entirely clear of the track marked out
by Secretary Seward, the great body of his argument being drawn from
events and precedents in the history of our own country.… We take
the greater pleasure in referring to the elaborate arguments brought forward
by Senator Sumner, inasmuch as certain parties seem to think that Secretary
Seward’s able reply to Lord Lyons on this subject was nothing but a
graceful backing down before superior force,&mdash;that he strove to hunt up
precedents on behalf of a position which was in fact defensible only because
our Government could not accept the gauntlet thrown down by that of
Great Britain. No unprejudiced person, we think, can peruse Mr. Sumner’s
speech without arriving at a different conclusion. It should rather be
an occasion for national congratulation than humiliation, that Great Britain
has, <i>de facto</i>, abandoned her old ground, and planted herself on doctrines
and practice strictly, and for a time almost exclusively, American.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Burlington Daily Times</i>, of Vermont, said:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“We have not room to print the elaborate and convincing argument of
Senator Sumner on the seizure of the Rebel emissaries, Mason and Slidell.
Notwithstanding all that has been said, it is fresh and original, and is a
complete vindication of the course of the Administration in promptly restoring
the seized persons to the British Government. It cannot remove the
animosities which the course of England has kindled among Americans;
but it cannot fail to heal the galled sense of wounded national honor, because
it is shown by the argument that it has not been wounded at all,&mdash;that
the feeling of shame and dishonor which has been experienced has been
resting on imaginary and false grounds.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Boston Transcript</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Fortunately for Mr. Sumner, events have arisen which have enabled
him to demonstrate that he is not ridden by one idea. As Chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Affairs, the most important post that a Senator of the
United States can hold in the present emergency of the nation, he has shown
talents and acquirements which every fair mind cannot but appreciate.
The ‘inevitable negro’ is banished from this arena, and the country has
been astonished by the solidity of Mr. Sumner’s learning, the amplitude of
his understanding, and the sagacity of his judgment on all the vital questions
which have arisen in his special department. His speech on the affair
of the Trent is a masterpiece. He goes beyond all the precedents of the
conservative lawyers of New England, and all the arguments of the Secretary
of State, to the essential principles of International Law, as recognized
by the great thinkers and statesmen of the Continent of Europe, and as contended
for by our own Government. He, the man who has most cause to
hate Slidell and Mason, and who, from his Abolitionist proclivities, would be
most opposed to delivering them up, is found to exceed even Mr. Seward in
his desire to establish the rights of neutrals and ignore the passions of the
hour.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Norfolk County Journal</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is a work of supererogation to say one word in its praise. Public
opinion has already stamped it as one of the great speeches of the present
generation of American statesmen. In the acquaintance which it displays
with International Law, the impregnability of its argument, the classic finish
of its diction, and the statesmanlike temper which it brings to the discussion,
it has gained for its author new honors, and done much to counteract a
prejudice against our Senator which too many had mistakenly allowed to
possess their minds.”</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Haverhill Publisher</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The late speech of the Senator on the Trent affair is one of the ablest
state papers that have appeared in this country for years, and will have a
powerful influence upon the English mind in settling the present disturbed
state of feeling, and also in securing the practical acknowledgment of a
great principle in International Law. Those who have found the most fault
of late with Mr. Sumner for his efforts to keep fresh before the country the
cause of our present disaster, as an important thing to be considered, while
struggling for relief, are now among the first to do him honor for his unanswerable
argument upon the Trent Question, and the principle involved.
In the end, the country and the world will as fully agree with him, practically,
upon the question of Slavery. No man can more truly be said to be
the man for the hour than can Senator Sumner.”</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>
<p>The <i>Salem Gazette</i> said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is a pleasure to accord to Senator Sumner the approval of his most
judicious course on the same subject. We take the more pleasure in this
approval, because it has often been our fortune to differ with Mr. Sumner
in regard to the treatment of some of the most important questions before
the country. But in regard to our foreign relations, holding as he does the
responsible position of Chairman of the Senate Committee on that subject,
we confide in him as a safe, wise, and thoroughly well-informed guide.”</p>

</div>

<p>These are illustrations of the American press. Very different was
that of London, so far as it spoke. One of our countrymen, then
abroad, and closely observing the manifestations of opinion, remarked
that the speech was attacked, but not reprinted.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The excellence of any such effort is to be measured now in this country
only by the amount of attack it calls out, and I was therefore much pleased
to see that the <i>Times</i> lost its temper in criticizing you. It is a significant
fact, that neither it nor any of its allies have ventured to reprint the speech.
They confine themselves to a style of criticism that I should call blackguard,
against you, Mr. Seward, and Mr. Everett.”</p>

</div>

<p>In contrast with the prevailing tone was the London Peace Society,
which, in its Annual Report, spoke of the speech.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They felt it right to reprint the very able speech delivered by Mr.
Charles Sumner on the affair of the Trent, because, while explicitly surrendering
every right on the part of the American Government, as respects
that transaction, he does so on such broad principles as in the judgment of
the Committee it would be greatly to the advantage of all civilized states to
adopt and act upon in their relations with each other. Copies of this pamphlet
were sent to all Members of Parliament, and to a large number of
newspapers and periodicals throughout the kingdom.”<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The character of the attack by the <i>Times</i> will be seen by a few passages
from a leader, January 25, 1862.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The last mail has brought us another attempt, made in a speech five
columns long by Mr. Charles Sumner in the American Senate. This gentleman
is, perhaps, the one American who has been most petted and fêted over
here. Mr. Charles Sumner was the greatest drawing-room lion of his day,
and his mane was combed by a thousand delicate hands, often held up in
admiration at his gentle roarings. In America he has arrived at the high
distinction of Senator for Massachusetts and Chairman of the Committee for
Foreign Affairs; but after the very general hilarity throughout Europe
caused by Mr. Seward’s diplomatic <i>fiasco</i>, it seems to have been thought
necessary to put some one forward to make ‘a scathing exposition of British
inconsistency,’ and to show what a victory over the old country had been
obtained. So Charles Sumner is the man.… Mr. Sumner has not done
his work ill. But then he had peculiar facilities for it. ‘Who best has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>known them can abuse them best.’ Moreover, his audience at Washington
was not difficult. Gentlemen who could congratulate themselves on Bull
Run required no cogent reasons for seeing a glorious triumph, first in the
seizure of the Trent, and then in the compulsory surrender of the prize.…
No wonder, then, that Mr. Charles Sumner’s speech in the Senate has
been a great success. We are told that all the foreign ambassadors&mdash;except
only Lord Lyons, whom nothing but severe diplomatic etiquette kept
away&mdash;came round him and congratulated him; and that after its delivery,
‘our respected mother, England,’ is ‘left out in the cold,’&mdash;whatever that
may mean. The two points which seem especially to have been admired
are, first, ‘the absence of any allusion in his speech to the Negro Question,’&mdash;showing
that he is by no means so obstinate upon that matter as had been
feared,&mdash;and, second, ‘the signal rebuke he administered to England.’ We
can go some way with Mr. Sumner’s encomiasts in this admiration. It at
least shows a versatile and cosmopolitan mind. His ‘allusions to the Negro
Question’ are evidently only absent from his Washington speeches because
they are kept entirely for English use, and are not fitted for home consumption;
whereas the ‘rebukes’ are manufactured expressly for the American
market, and are never offered for acceptance on this side of the Atlantic.…
It is of no great consequence to us what clouds of dust American
statesmen may choose to raise in order to escape from their difficulty. Now
that they have eaten the leek, they may declare, if they please, that it was
exquisite in its flavor, and had been presented to them as a mark of
honor.…</p>

<p>“The case of the Trent has not made any new precedent whatever, nor
can it clash with any precedent upon which in modern times we ever did or
could have intended to rely. The forcible removal of those four men from
under the British flag was a rude outrage, redeemed neither by precedent nor
principle, and it has been resented and repaired. If all the Federal Senate
make set speeches till doomsday, they can make no more of it.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the course of its objurgations, the <i>Times</i> seeks to repel the parallel
between the taking by Captain Wilkes and the taking of American citizens
by British cruisers, and here it asserts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In the current number of the <i>Quarterly Review</i> it is conclusively shown
that only two men ‘claiming to be Americans’ were taken by our cruisers
out of American ships in the year preceding the war of 1812.”<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

</div>

<p>“Only two men ‘claiming to be Americans’”! Lord Castlereagh, in
the House of Commons, immediately after the breaking out of the war,
admitted that there were in the British fleet three thousand five hundred
men “who claimed to be American subjects.”<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> The <i>Times</i> perhaps
intended “only two men” really American. But here is strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
and total oblivion of the fact, that, in every case of taking, whether the
victim was American or not, whether two or two hundred were seized,
there was an exercise of the very prerogative it condemned in Captain
Wilkes, although he had an excuse beyond that of any British cruiser.</p>

<p>This leader of the <i>Times</i> was followed by an article, dated at the Temple,
January 28, from its famous correspondent “Historicus,” known to
be Mr. Vernon Harcourt, a writer of admirable power on questions of International
Law, and afterwards a distinguished member of Parliament.
In this article the same spirit appeared, with the same personality, and
the same hardihood of assertion. Beginning with elaborate flings at
Mr. George Sumner, where the causticity is reinforced from <i>Martin
Chuzzlewit</i>, he comes to the Senator, and, in the tone already adopted
by the <i>Times</i>, refers to his reception in London: “It would be scarcely
too much to say, that, for a single season, Mr. Charles Sumner enjoyed
a social success almost equal to that of the ‘Black Sam’ himself. He
was regarded as ‘a man and a brother,’ and he could not have been better
treated, if he had had real black blood in his veins.” This is to
prepare for what follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is impossible adequately to describe the ‘threat speech’ in the Senate,
except by saying that Charles, if possible, out-Sumners George. The great
object of this remarkable oration is to prove that the surrender of Messrs. Slidell
and Mason is a great triumph for the American Government. There is,
proverbially, no accounting for taste; and if the American people are of Mr.
Sumner’s opinion, I do not see why we should complain of their contentment.
Some people, like Uriah Heep, are ‘very ’umble,’ and their meekness is an
edifying spectacle. We demanded the restoration of the prisoners, not in
order to mortify the American people, but for the purpose of vindicating
the honor of our flag and asserting the established principles of Maritime
Law.”</p>

</div>

<p>In exposing Mr. Sumner’s misfeasance, the writer proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As if to make the absurdity of his position more conspicuous, Mr. Sumner
invokes the sympathies of ‘Continental Governments’ for the doctrine
of Mr. Seward’s despatch. He has even the incredible audacity (if it be
not, indeed, an ignorance hardly less credible) to pledge the authority of M.
Hautefeuille in support of the pretension to treat Messrs. Slidell and Mason
as ‘contraband of war.’”</p>

</div>

<p>This is followed by an extract from M. Hautefeuille, declaring that a
neutral ship, destined for a neutral port, is not subject to seizure.</p>

<p>This passage shows that the writer had in mind something very different
from the speech he criticized. Mr. Sumner nowhere alludes to
Mr. Seward’s despatch, much less does he invoke the sympathies of
Continental Europe for its doctrines. Nor does he pledge the authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
of M. Hautefeuille in support of the pretension to treat the Rebel agents
as contraband of war; on the contrary, he mentioned M. Hautefeuille
as having “entered into this debate with a direct proposition for the
release of the emissaries as a testimony to the true interpretation of International
Law,”<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> and himself insists upon the very doctrine of the
French publicist. Plainly, therefore, the writer dealt hard words at
Mr. Sumner, mistaking him for somebody else.</p>

<p>Then comes another misapprehension.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I know not whether, in the hazy muddle of a confused intelligence, Mr.
Sumner has figured to himself that the seizure of Messrs. Slidell and Mason
is a parallel case to the instances of impressment of seamen out of which
grew the war of 1812. Yet men of less pretensions than the ‘Chairman of
the Committee of Foreign Relations’ ought to be aware that the cases are
not only not the same, but not even similar. Their resemblance, at most,
extends to the proverbial identity of chalk and cheese.”</p>

</div>

<p>Evidently the writer had not read the opinion of the law officers,
individualizing the point, that “from on board a merchant ship of a
neutral power, pursuing a lawful and innocent voyage, certain individuals
have been taken by force,”<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> which was the precise point so often
urged by the United States against impressment.</p>

<p>Then follow the general condemnation and counterblast.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is impossible to read such performances as the ‘Great Speech of the
Hon. C. Sumner’ without drawing a gloomy augury for the future of a nation
among whom such a man can occupy a chief place. In all the symptoms
of decadence which the recent history of the American Republic
exhibits, there is none more conspicuous and apparently more irreparable
than the decline in capacity and character of her public men. The men
bred under the shadow of the English colonial system were of a very different
stamp from the race which progressive Democracy has spawned for
itself.…</p>

<p>“But now, whether we turn to the puerile absurdities of President Lincoln’s
message, or to the confused and transparent sophistry of Mr. Seward’s
despatch, or to the feeble and illogical malice of Mr. Sumner’s oration, we
see nothing on every side but a melancholy spectacle of impotent violence
and furious incapacity.”</p>

<p>In the volume of Historicus,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> much of which constitutes a valuable
contribution to International Law, this effusion is abridged and modified.
Some things are left out, and others are changed. Generally the personalities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
are mitigated. Thus, the original caption, “The Brothers Sumner
on International Law,” is turned into “Letter on Mr. Sumner’s
Speech,” and “the hazy muddle of a confused intelligence” is softened
into “a confusion of mind” attributed to Mr. Sumner; but the article
is introduced by words describing the speech as “<em>professing</em> to expound
and to maintain the doctrines of Mr. Seward’s despatch,” and it repeats
the allegation that “Mr. Sumner invokes the sympathies of ‘Continental
Governments’ for the doctrine of Mr. Seward’s despatch,” whereas, in
fact, he never professed or did any such thing. It would be pleasant
to forget that an article of such a character was ever written; nor would
it be mentioned here, if it did not throw important light&mdash;and not
to be neglected&mdash;on the general tone of the British press and its unfounded
conduct towards our Republic at a critical moment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Contemporary letters from countrymen abroad tell how they were
impressed.</p>

<p>At home, persons in all conditions&mdash;statesmen, judges, lawyers,
clergymen, authors, citizens&mdash;made haste to express gratification and
sympathy. This copious correspondence evinces the intensity and extent
of the prevailing sentiment, which can be learned in no other way.
Thus it illustrates an important chapter of history.</p>

<p>A letter from Hon. Richard H. Dana, Jr., District Attorney of the
United States at Boston, and afterwards the annotator of Wheaton’s
“Elements of International Law,” an able publicist, full of good feeling
for England, though written at Boston, may be introduced here, as
it bears especially upon the conduct of England and the English press.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Permit me to say that I am glad to see the London <i>Times’</i> attack on you
and your Trent speech. It will make you feel to the quick&mdash;what you
did not seem to feel, or refused to admit&mdash;the <em>insolent</em> tone of the British
press and public men towards us in our struggle for life, and the false manner
in which they have tried to turn this case to our national ruin. Those
few semi-republican, semi-abolition, liberally inclined men in England,
whom you respect, and who command, perhaps, one paper and one monthly,
are a drop in the bucket. The ruling class in England is determined to
sever this Republic, and all its pent-up jealousy, arrogance, and superciliousness
are breaking out stronger and stronger.</p>

<p>“There is not one English paper that I have seen which has not either
suppressed or falsified the material facts of this case, because they know,
that, properly understood, they would not support the hostile feeling against
this country the papers depended upon keeping up. I am rejoiced to know
that you feel this.</p>

<p>“I have had a letter from England, from a high source, which speaks of
your speech as very able, etc., etc., but says, “No paper has dared to publish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>it,” and speaks of their attacking without publishing it, thus making
it apparent that it is read.</p>

<p>“One of my letters says, ‘It is an excellent speech, but it has cost him
his favor in England.’</p>

<p>“I write these things to you because I take pleasure in them. They are
<em>the best omen for you</em> that I have seen.”</p>

<p>Hon. George R. Russell, an excellent citizen of Boston, travelling in
Europe, wrote from Florence:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The <i>Times</i> has come down on you, and has failed. It has the usual
bitterness, but the power is wanting.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. James E. Harvey, Minister Resident at Lisbon, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have just read your speech on the Trent affair, and cannot refrain from
expressing my thanks for its able and conclusive vindication of the position
of our Government on that subject. If any reasoning can reconcile the
American mind to the restitution of the two emissaries to British protection,
your arguments and the calm and convincing presentation of facts must do
it. What you have said of Hautefeuille might be justly applied to this
statesmanlike production, which, in comprehension and in logical connection,
is a state paper.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Bradford R. Wood, Minister Resident at Copenhagen, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I thank you for your speech on Maritime Rights, just received, and
which I have carefully read. All my assertions that the Trent affair would
not lead to war were received here with incredulity, by the Government, by
my colleagues, by all parties. It was a bitter disappointment to some of the
English here, and I doubt not in England, that this matter has been settled
without war. The London <i>Times</i>, while criticizing your speech and denying
its conclusions, writhes under it, and its arguments are a severer rebuke
to England than any philippics or denunciations could be.”</p>

</div>

<p>William S. Thayer, Consul-General at Alexandria, wrote from his
post:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I lent Mr. Buckle<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> the <i>Intelligencer</i> with your speech on the Trent affair,

<p>Hon. John Bigelow, Consul at Paris, and afterwards Minister there,
wrote from Paris:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It produced an excellent effect here, and still better in England, if one

of that journal, under the circumstances, was more complimentary than its
praise could have been.”</p>

<p>Henry Woods, the Parisian member of the American importing house

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have to thank you for a copy of your very able speech on the Trent
affair, which has been very much read, and in all quarters I hear it spoken
of with admiration. It is considered your greatest effort, and worthy of a
great occasion.”</p>

</div>

<p>Professor Charles D. Cleveland, author and Abolitionist, Consul at
Cardiff, Wales, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“How my heart rejoices that the affair of the Trent is thus amicably settled!
but&mdash;and I <em>must</em> say so&mdash;I have little faith in the good feeling of the
Government of England, and the leading influences here, towards our country.
How indignant have I felt the last six weeks at the tone of the leading papers
towards our country! Nothing, hardly, could exceed the bitterness of the
<i>Times</i>, the <i>Post</i>, the <i>Telegraph</i>, the <i>Saturday Review</i>, &amp;c., &amp;c. Even <i>Punch</i>
lent all his influence to the Rebels, and against us. The very first number
after the news of the Trent affair was received had a full-length figure of
Britannia standing beside a cannon, with a match in her hand, looking across
the water, and underneath was written, ‘Waiting for an Answer.’</p>

<p>“True, the religious public, or rather the Dissenters, have shown right
feelings; and I wrote letters of thanks to Dr. Newman Hall and to Mr. Spurgeon
for what they had done, and received very kind answers; but very few
of the Church Establishment have shown right feelings.</p>

<p>“I was always the friend of England, and few have written or spoken more
in commendation of her; but I must in truth say that my feelings have
changed since I have been here. England would rejoice to-day to see our
country divided. She sees our growing greatness, and envies and fears it.”</p>

</div>

<p>In close connection with letters from abroad is that of E. Littell,
founder and editor of the <i>Living Age</i>, close student of the English press,
and warmly attached to England, who wrote from Boston:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Allow me to congratulate you upon the speech on the Trent affair.
‘They of the contrary part,’ even, ‘cannot gainsay it.’</p>

<p>“After feeling so deeply the almost unbroken attitude of the London press
as to be forced to think and say that I must give up my love for England
(which was a part of my inmost heart), I have reverted to her again, pleading
that that press does not represent either her people or her Government.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Henry L. Dawes, the eminent Representative in Congress,
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I congratulate you on your great effort to-day. It was worthy of you.
I regret I could not hear it all. But I shall have the greater pleasure in
reading it.”</p>

<p>Hon. Hamilton Fish, afterwards Secretary of State, wrote from New
York:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<em>Exactly</em> right; you have done justice to the question, the country, its
history, its policy, and its late action. On such ground as you have placed
the subject we stand proudly before the world.…</p>

<p>“It should be circulated largely in England, among the class who will
read it. The British press will not publish it in full, unless you can bring,
through some of your friends, an influence to bear. Cannot you do so?”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. N. P. Talmadge, former Senator of the United States from New
York, wrote from Georgetown, District of Columbia:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have just read with great pleasure your very able speech in regard to
Messrs. Mason and Slidell and the recent affair of the Trent. Coming in
support of the lucid and able reply of Mr. Seward to Lord Lyons, it places
the matter before the American people and all Europe in a light as clear as
a sunbeam.</p>

<p>“It seems to me that England, in the excitement of the moment, and with
the sudden impulse of redressing a fancied wrong, has not foreseen the inevitable
result to which her own action has brought her. She may attempt
hereafter, as occasion may require, to evade the consequences by saying that
the law officers of the crown decided that the wrong consisted in not taking
the Trent into port for the adjudication of a Prize Court, and therefore that
was the only point involved. She will find, however, that not only the
United States, but France, and all Europe, will hold her to the consequences
which you have so clearly demonstrated flow from her own action.</p>

<p>“Mr. Seward’s reply to Lord Lyons, and your speech, will settle this whole
question with the American people. If their judgments are satisfied, they
cheerfully acquiesce, no matter how high their passions may have been
wrought against these Rebels, nor how strong their desire to keep possession
of them. I believe there is not a loyal press that has not acquiesced in the
decision of the Administration. How proudly all this contrasts with the
predictions of Dr. Russell, the correspondent of the London <i>Times</i>, that, if
these men were given up, the Government would be dissolved and destroyed
by the mob! This will show England that a British ministry have much
more to fear from her mobs than the Administration of this Government have
to fear from our people.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Julius Rockwell, the Judge, and former Senator of the United
States, with lifelong experience, political and judicial, wrote from
Pittsfield, Massachusetts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The public opinion, as far as I know it here, is in accordance with the
positions set forth in your speech, and your speech will tend to illustrate and
render it more general. Still, some are unsatisfied, and there is a general, I
may say, almost universal, accession of dissatisfaction with the conduct and
character of England. This feeling just now pervades our people, crops out
in all lectures, and in many sermons, and some prayers.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Daniel Ullmann, prominent in the politics of New York, and a
General in the war, wrote from his head-quarters:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>“You will greatly oblige me by sending to my address a pamphlet copy
of your great speech on the ‘Trent affair.’ I desire it in that form for preservation.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. James Duane Doty, Governor of Utah, and former Representative
in Congress, wrote from Salt Lake City:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Far, far from you, on the top of the Rocky Mountains, I have just held
communion with you by a perusal of your able, eloquent, and conclusive
speech on the Trent affair, as reported in the <i>Herald</i> of the 10th January,
which has just reached us. Surely no nation was ever put in a more absurd
position than you have placed England, and if she is satisfied with the possession
of the Rebels (whom, I am glad to notice, you have not named), we
ought to be gratified; for it avoids a quarrel at an inconvenient time, and
allays public feeling, which was becoming much excited. These two worthless
Rebels could not have been put to a better use.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Wayne MacVeagh, afterwards Minister at Constantinople, wrote
from West Chester, Pennsylvania:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I cannot refrain from expressing to you the personal obligation I feel for
your last great speech. Its wise candor and its steadfast adherence to the
landmarks of maritime freedom cannot fail to make a profound impression
upon the liberal minds of Europe; while disclaiming the thought of her dishonor,
you have lifted the Republic to the heights of a beneficent victory.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. B. C. Clark, merchant, and Consul for Hayti, wrote from Boston:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Your speech on the Mason and Slidell matter has won, most justly, golden
opinions from all sorts of people. The affair has been put to rest, but simply
on legal grounds.… The Trent will tell more terribly upon England than
the ghost of Cæsar upon Brutus at Philippi.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. George T. Bigelow, Chief Justice of Massachusetts, wrote from
Boston:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have read your speech on the Trent affair with very great pleasure.
It is an admirable exposition of the doctrine which England has so
long held on the subject of neutral rights; and while it demonstrates that
the act of Captain Wilkes might have been justified on English practice and
precedents, it places in the most clear light that it was inconsistent with the
position which our Government has always occupied on the subject of search
and seizure. The tone of the speech is so quiet and dignified, that it will
have the effect, I think, of a severe rebuke on the hasty and unjustifiable
conduct of the English Cabinet in demanding a reparation and a surrender
of the captives with warlike menaces and preparations.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>

<p>“The prevailing sentiment here, especially among those who have not
heretofore been inclined to speak your praise, is one of commendation of
your speech. I am rejoiced that you have been able, while vindicating the
course of the Administration in making the surrender of Mason and Slidell,
to add so much to your reputation as a statesman.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Theophilus Parsons, the eminent law-writer and law-professor,
wrote from Cambridge:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have read and studied your speech, and am really unwilling to repeat
to you what I have said in commendation of it to others.</p>

<p>“This question may be considered after the fashion of a lawyer, or a politician,
or a statesman.</p>

<p>“You have viewed it as a statesman, and, in my understanding of the
word, that includes the other two, and elevates them both.</p>

<p>“The affair has given rise to no paper so entirely satisfactory to me, nor
to one calculated, in my judgment, to be so truly and permanently useful.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Emory Washburn, Professor at the Law School, and former
Governor of Massachusetts, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I cannot forbear expressing my satisfaction in reading your speech in
the Senate on the Trent affair. It seems to me to place the matter on the
true ground; and if the English Government do not find, when they come
to look coolly at the matter, that in taking Mason and Slidell they have
caught two Tartars, I shall be greatly mistaken. I think, moreover, you
have spoken the sober, sound thought of the country; and while they are
indignant at the inconsistent annoyance of the ministry and the press of
England, they feel that the course taken is not only the wise and expedient
one, but, on the whole, the most consistent.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. John H. Clifford, former Attorney-General of Massachusetts,
and Governor, wrote from Boston:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have read with unqualified approval and satisfaction your admirable
exposition of the interesting questions of public law in your recent speech,
growing out of the arrest and rendition of the ‘two old men’ taken from the
Trent. I trust its treatment of the doctrine of Maritime Rights will command
on the other side of the water the respect to which it is so justly entitled,
and of which its reception by the best minds at home gives a hopeful
assurance.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. John C. Gray, a venerable and accomplished citizen, wrote from
Boston:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I return you my acknowledgments for your speech on the Mason and
Slidell affair. The more I have examined the law,&mdash;and I regret that I did
not do it earlier,&mdash;the more I am satisfied that our civilians here were mistaken
in their first impressions.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. George S. Hale, lawyer, wrote from Boston:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Permit me to congratulate you on your late speech in the Senate. I am
not unfamiliar with your speeches, and feel great pleasure in saying that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>none has ever, in my opinion, so strengthened your position as a statesman;
none has been more happy, more effective, or more generally satisfactory to
your constituents.</p>

<p>“Without calling up any of those questions upon which many of them
have differed from you, you have done much to contribute to public peace,
and aided well, under peculiarly difficult circumstances, in placing the
country in an honorable position before the world.”</p>

<p>Hon. Charles P. Huntington, late Judge of the Superior Court for
Suffolk County, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Having just read with great pleasure your speech on the Trent case, as
given in the <i>Tribune</i> of yesterday, I feel moved to express to you my satisfaction

<p>Hon. John Jay, afterwards Minister at Vienna, wrote from New

<p>Hon. Francis Brockholst Cutting, former Representative in Congress
from New York, and a leader of the bar, wrote from New York:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Your speech on Maritime Rights has given me very great satisfaction.
It was worthy of your reputation, and equal to the occasion. The argument
was particularly gratifying to me, because, from the outset, I had looked at
the case from the American point of view, and had expressed myself accordingly.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. R. J. Meigs, of Tennessee, for a long time eminent at the bar

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“One word more. I thank you for your speech upon the Trent affair.
It vindicates the honor of our baited and abused country. It will be a well-remembered
document in the diplomacy of the world, settling as it does forever
the immunity of neutrals from the insulting pretension of the right to
seize persons on their ships merely upon the ground that they owe allegiance
to the belligerent. It effectually extracts that poisonous fang from the jaws
of Leviathan.”</p>

<p>Hon. David Roberts, lawyer, and author of a “Treatise on Admiralty

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I deem it your best effort, settling, what to me was from the first <em>the</em>
embarrassing element in the Wilkes question, <em>a true American</em> definition
of ‘despatches.’</p>

<p>“I therefore thank you for the speech sincerely; and though differing
<i>toto cœlo</i> from you politically in other respects, I shall not withhold my
commendation from your present effort, deeming it, as I do, the paramount
duty of all to inculcate the lesson of loyalty everywhere, until this Government
is vindicated, and the existing Rebellion suppressed.”</p>

<p>Hon. George Wheatland, lawyer, wrote from Salem:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Allow me, for the first time of ever addressing you, to thank you for your
masterly statement of the Trent matter, which I have just risen from reading

<p>“You have put the matter in its true light.…</p>

<p>“Your speech will shed light, and, in fact, illuminate the whole subject,
and should be read by every one. By taking Mason &amp; Co. we were acting
on the English law; by giving them up, we act under our own view of
what the law should be, and have brought England over to adopting our
view.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Asahel Huntington, the veteran lawyer, wrote from Salem:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am always greatly obliged by your speeches, which you have had
the kindness to send me from time to time. They are all gems of the first
water, but the ‘Trent’ is the greatest gem of all,&mdash;so calm, so full, so exhaustive,
so statesmanlike, so Websterian in its statements, structure, and
heavy logic, that, on first reading it, before receiving the pamphlet, I had it
in my heart to write you at once and express my high admiration of that
great passage in your public life. It was a great opportunity, and was met
in the true spirit of a controversy between nations on questions of International
Law. It was potential for good at home and abroad, and is worthy
itself to be trusted as an authority from its own intrinsic weight.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. George Morey, lawyer, and for a long time a political leader in
Massachusetts, wrote from Boston:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

our foreign relations, and particularly the case of the Trent.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>

<p>“Your speech comes exceedingly apropos, following in the track of Mr.
Seward’s despatch. As that despatch will be looked upon in England with
some suspicion, as proceeding from an artful and wily statesman, and there
may be a disposition to regard it as a cunning <em>dodge</em>, &amp;c., it is very fortunate
that your speech will follow in the wake of Mr. Seward’s letter. A very
great number of distinguished men in England, statesmen, diplomatists, &amp;c.,
will say, Mr. Sumner is honest, he speaks his real sentiments. Besides, it
will be said that Mr. Sumner is a most decided Antislavery man, and he
is heartily engaged in putting down this great Rebellion, not because he desires
to fight for <em>empire</em>, as Earl Russell stated in a speech some time since
our Government were, but because he is anxious to extinguish Slavery, and
because he knows that Slavery is the origin of this war. I am satisfied your
speech will have an excellent effect in England, and also in France, and all
over the Continent. You have done a capital thing towards conciliating the
favor and good-will of our State Street gentlemen. Mr. Cartwright, President
of the Manufacturers’ Insurance Office, where I am a director, says you
have done excellent service to the country and the good cause. He has a
pretty large amount of war risks. Your short speech in answer to Mr. Hale
was commended very highly everywhere.”</p>

<p>Hon. Theophilus P. Chandler, lawyer, wrote from Boston:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Your Trent speech is by far the best thing I have read on the subject.

<p>William I. Bowditch, conveyancer and Abolitionist, wrote from Boston:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

of your constituents. I cannot be supposed to be much versed in International
Law, but I understand your argument, and am sure that every one
who reads must understand. I see not how you could have made it more
clear or cogent. You condense the history of a vexed question into a crystalline
lens, and every eye must see your point. I greatly mistake, if your
views do not produce conviction both at home and abroad. You have performed
a service to the true and the right which will surely be appreciated

afford a war with England when we have this diabolical Rebellion. I
am glad of your forbearance towards her, but I fear this generation will
not forgive.”</p>

WITH OTHER OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, on the Case of General Lane,
of Kansas, January 13, 1862.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The question of the seat of Hon. James H. Lane, of Kansas, was
referred to the Judiciary Committee of the Senate, at the extra session
of July, 1861, when the Committee reported that he was not entitled to
his seat. The consideration of the resolution was postponed to the
present session.</p>

<p>It appeared, that, previously to the extra session, and before Mr. Lane
had taken his seat as Senator from Kansas, he was designated by President
Lincoln as Brigadier-General of Volunteers, and entered upon his
public duties as such, but without any actual commission or formal
appointment according to law. Afterwards, when informed that he
could not be Brigadier-General and at the same time Senator, he
abandoned the former post and was duly qualified as Senator. Meanwhile
Governor Robinson of Kansas, assuming that Mr. Lane had so
far accepted another office as to vacate his seat in the Senate, appointed
Hon. Frederic P. Stanton in his place, and the Judiciary Committee
affirmed the title of the latter.</p>

<p>January 13th, Mr. Sumner spoke against the report.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;The Senator from Connecticut
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>] has presented the objections
to the seat of General Lane ingeniously and ably; but
I must frankly confess that he fails to satisfy me. I
could not resist the brief, but decisive, statement of the
Senator from New York [Mr. <span class="smcap">Harris</span>], to which we
listened the other day; and the ampler argument of the
Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>], to which
we have listened to-day, seems to leave little more to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
be said. I shall follow the latter without adding to the
argument.</p>

<p>The language of the Constitution applicable to the
case is explicit: “No person holding any office under
the United States shall be a member of either House
of Congress during his continuance in office.” But the
question arises, Did General Lane hold any such office
after he became Senator?</p>

<p>Not considering the case minutely, I content myself
with briefly touching two points, either of which will
be sufficient to secure his seat to General Lane.</p>

<p>1. At the time when the military appointment was
received from the President, General Lane was simply
Senator elect from Kansas, and not actually Senator.
This cannot be questioned. Until he took the oath
at your chair, Sir, he was Senator in title only, not in
function. It is true, he already exercised the franking
privilege; but this he will also exercise months after
his term expires. The franking privilege was all that
he possessed of Senatorial functions. On this point I
read what is said by Mr. Cushing, in his elaborate work
on the Law and Practice of Legislative Assemblies.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sec. 2.</span> <i>Refusal to qualify.</i> One who is returned a member
of a legislative assembly, and assumes a seat as such,
is bound to take the oaths required of him, and perform
such other acts as may be necessary to qualify him, if any,
to discharge the duties of his office. If a member elect refuses
to qualify, he will be discharged from being a member,
with more or less of obloquy, or none at all, according to
the circumstances of his case; but he cannot be expelled, because
he cannot as yet discharge the duties of a member.”<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>It is clear that the member elect is not invested with
the office until qualified by taking the oath. If illustration
of this rule be needed, it will be found in the
Parliamentary History of Great Britain. Soon after
the Revolution of 1688, two persons returned as members
refused to take the oaths and were discharged. But
there is an historic precedent almost of our own day.
As the long contest for Catholic Emancipation in Great
Britain was drawing to a close, Mr. O’Connell was
elected by the County of Clare to a seat in Parliament.
Presenting himself at the bar of the House of
Commons, he refused to take the Oath of Supremacy,
then required of all members, and was heard at the bar
in support of his claim; but the House resolved that
he was not entitled to sit or vote, unless he took this
oath; and as he persisted in refusal, a writ was issued
for a new election. Still later, the same question arose
in the case of Baron Rothschild, the eminent banker of
the Jewish persuasion, who, when elected as representative
for the city of London, refused to take the oaths
required, and on this account was kept out of his seat,
until what is known as the Jews’ Relief Bill became
a law. The conclusion is irresistible, that, until the
oath was taken, General Lane had not entered upon
his functions as Senator; and here the argument of the
Senator from Connecticut, with regard to the effect of
the oath, is strictly applicable. An oath in public, at
your chair, Sir, being at once of record and sealing the
acceptance of an office, is very different from the informal
oath taken in private, at a distance, before a
local magistrate, which is in the nature of an escrow,
until recorded in the proper department.</p>

<p>2. Even if General Lane had been Senator, invested
with the functions of the office, and completely qualified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
by taking the necessary oath, it is still clear that the
military duties he had undertaken did not operate as a
resignation. And here I remark, that, when it is proposed
to unseat a Senator, to deprive him of a place in
this body,&mdash;I might almost say to deprive him of his
rank,&mdash;the evidence must be complete. It must be,
according to that old phrase of the Common Law, “certainty
to a certain intent in every particular.” If there
be doubt, either in law or fact, the interpretation should
be in his favor. But this case requires no such interpretation.
It is true that General Lane had entered
upon certain military duties, but he had assumed no
military office under the Constitution of the United
States. Colonel Baker, a late lamented member of this
body, had assumed military duties also. Like General
Lane, he, too, had come forward at the summons of
the President. It is true that Colonel Baker acted
professedly under a commission from a State. General
Lane has latterly acted under a similar commission;
but at the moment in question he was acting under
certain informal and extra-constitutional proceedings of
the President, rendered necessary by the exigencies of
the hour. The President, by proclamation, undertook
to organize an army. He called for volunteers, and
also for additions to the regular army. All approved
the patriotic act. But I am at a loss to understand
how it is supposed that this proceeding can be made
effective to oust a Senator of his seat. The act of the
President was proper, just, and patriotic; but clearly,
and beyond all question, it needed the sanction of Congress
to be completely legal. Without such sanction,
the army must have drawn its breath from the proclamation
alone, and every commission would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
merely a token of Presidential confidence, liable to
be defeated, first, by the failure of Congress to sanction
the proclamation, and, secondly, by refusal of the
Senate to advise and consent to the nomination. It
was only when the Act of July 22d was passed, that
the President was authorized to appoint new Brigadier-Generals.
Then it was, for the first time, that a legal
addition was made to the national army, and that this
very office was legally created which General Lane was
charged with accepting some time in June.</p>

<p>I do not forget the retroactive statute passed on the
last day of the session, declaring that all the acts,
proclamations, and orders of the President respecting
the army and navy, and calling out or relating to the
militia or volunteers, are approved, and in all respects
legalized and made valid, to the same intent and with
the same effect as if they had been issued and done
under the previous express authority and direction of
Congress. The clause in the Constitution against <i>ex
post facto</i> laws has been restricted by judicial interpretation
to criminal matters; but I doubt if even this
much questioned interpretation would sanction such a
retroactive effect as is now proposed. So much, at
least, I do know: the Senate is judge, without appeal,
with regard to the seats of its members; and I
am sure it will not unseat a Senator by a strained
application of an <i>ex post facto</i> statute.</p>

<p>The conclusion is twofold: first, that at the time in
question General Lane was not a Senator; and, secondly,
that at the time in question he was not a Brigadier.
The whole case is unreal. It is a question between
an imaginary Senator and an impossible Brigadier;
or rather, it is a question whether an imagined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
seat in this body was lost by alleged acts under an impossible
military commission. The seat of the Senator
did not become a reality until some days after General
Lane is supposed to have vacated it; and the military
commission did not become a possibility until several
weeks after General Lane had abandoned it.</p>

<p>Of course, with this view of the law on these two
decisive points, it becomes entirely unnecessary to consider
the multifarious and indefinite evidence with regard
to what General Lane did in the way of accepting
his military commission; because nothing that he did,
and nothing that he could do, under that impossible
commission, would operate legally in the present case.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>In reply to Mr. Davis, of Kentucky, Mr. Sumner spoke further.</p>

</div>

<p>I have no desire to follow at length the Senator from
Kentucky, but I venture to ask the attention of the
Senate simply to one of the points he has presented.
According to him, General Lane, when elected as Senator,
by the mere fact of his election became Senator, so
that the Constitution operated to create an incompatibility
between the function of Senator and the new office
which it is said he accepted. The Senator from
Kentucky, as I understood, argued that the function of
the Senator, at least for the purpose of this case, commences
with his election.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Davis.</span> Will the Senator from Massachusetts permit
me to ask him a question?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Certainly, if the Senator will allow me
just to make my statement. The Senator, I say, assumes
that the function of the Senator, at least for the purposes
of this case, commences with his election; and in support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
of that assumption he quotes the Constitution of
the United States, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“No Senator or Representative shall, during the time for
which he was elected, be appointed to any civil office, under
the authority of the United States, which shall have been created,
or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased,
during such time.”</p>

</div>

<p>Now, Mr. President, I most humbly submit that the
clause of the Constitution just quoted is entirely inapplicable.
It has nothing to do with the question. I
say, with all respect to the Senator, he might as well
have quoted anything else in the Constitution. It does
not bear on the case. It relates to an entirely different
matter. There is another associate clause which does
directly bear on this question. It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And no person holding any office under the United
States shall be a member of either House during his continuance
in office.”</p>

</div>

<p>Those are the words, Sir, governing this case, and
they conduct us directly to the question, when and at
what time a person becomes a member of either House.
That is the simple question.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Davis.</span> Will the Senator now permit me?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I will finish in one moment. Clearly
he becomes a member of this body, so as to discharge
his duties as Senator, and to be affected with the responsibilities
of Senator, only when he has taken his
oath at your desk, Sir,&mdash;not one minute before. There
is nothing in the Constitution, there is nothing in the
practice of any parliamentary body in this country, or
in any other country, I think, pointing to any different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
conclusion. Here I cannot err. The language of the
Constitution is sufficiently precise, and I feel confident
that the practice of Congress and of other parliamentary
bodies is sufficiently authoritative. Therefore the
conclusion is inevitable, that, until the 4th of July, last
summer, General Lane, chosen Senator by the people
of Kansas, was simply Senator elect, possessed through
courtesy of the franking privilege, but enjoying no other
Senatorial function.</p>

<p>Now I am ready to answer any question of the Senator.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Davis.</span> I would ask the Senator from Massachusetts
if the office of Senator from the State of Kansas was vacant
until General Lane qualified as a member of this body?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> In a certain sense I should say it was.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Davis.</span> When he qualified, did or did not his office
have reference to the time of his election, and take its date
from the date of his election?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I should say in a certain sense it did. I
have already said that he had the franking privilege, and
I presume he was entitled to the emoluments of the place,
such as they are; but had he not been qualified, he could
not have drawn pay. It was only by taking the oath that
he was entitled to pay from the Secretary of the Senate.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Davis.</span> The Senator knows well, that, assuming his
premises to be true, whenever the Senator from Kansas consummated
his election by taking his seat and taking the
oath of office, his term dated back to the date of his election.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The Senator must pardon me, if I cannot
assent to his conclusion. He may have been a Senator to a
certain extent, but not so as to create incompatibility with
another office under the Constitution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p>December 16, 1861, Mr. Wilkinson, of Minnesota, submitted to the
Senate a resolution for the expulsion of Hon. Jesse D. Bright, a Senator
from Indiana, on account of a letter to Jefferson Davis, which was
pronounced “evidence of disloyalty to the United States, and calculated
to give aid and comfort to the public enemies.” The resolution was
referred to the Judiciary Committee, which reported upon it adversely;
but, on consideration and debate, it was adopted, so that Mr. Bright
was expelled.</p>

<p>January 21, 1862, Mr. Sumner spoke as follows.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;The expulsion of a Senator is
one of the most solemn acts which this body can
be called to perform. The sentence of a court in a capital
case is hardly more solemn; for, though your judgment
cannot take away life, it may take away all that
gives value to life. Justice herself might well hesitate
to lift the scales in which such a destiny is weighed.
But duties in this world cannot be avoided. When cast
upon us, they must be performed, at any cost of individual
pain or individual regret,&mdash;especially in the
present case, where the Senate, whose good name is in
question, and the country, whose welfare is at stake,
forbid us to hesitate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In other similar cases, arising out of recent events,
where the Senate has already acted, the persons in question
were absent, openly engaged in rebellion. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
was no occasion for argument or discussion. Their guilt
was conspicuous, like the rebellion itself. In the present
case, the person is not absent, openly engaged in
rebellion. He still sits among us, taking part in the
public business, voting and answering to his name,
when called in the roll of the Senate. His continued
presence may be interpreted in opposite ways, according
to the feelings of those who sit in judgment. It
may be referred to conscious innocence, or it may be
referred to audacious guilt.</p>

<p>That he takes his place in the Senate is not, therefore,
necessarily in his favor. Catiline, after plotting
the destruction of Rome, took his place in the Senate,
and listened to the orator who denounced the treason;
nor did the Roman patriot hesitate to point his eloquence
by the exclamation that the traitor even came
into the Senate,&mdash;“<i>etiam in Senatum venit</i>.” In the
history of our country there is a well-known instance of
kindred audacity. Benedict Arnold, after commencing
correspondence with the enemy, and before detection,
appeared at the bar of a court-martial in Philadelphia,
and yet, with treason not only in his heart, but already
in his acts, thus spoke, without a blush: “Conscious of
my own innocence and the unworthy methods taken to
injure me, I can with boldness say to my persecutors in
general, and to the chief of them in particular,”&mdash;and,
with this introduction, he alleged patriotic service.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> You
know well the result. The traitor thus appearing and
speaking in open court continued his treason. The
faithful historian does not hesitate to say that “at
the moment these declarations were uttered he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
been eight months in secret correspondence with the
enemy, and was prepared, if not resolved, when the
first opportunity should offer, to desert and betray his
country.”<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> History teaches by example; and the instances
that I adduce admonish us not to be governed
merely by appearances, but to look at things as they
are, and to judge according to facts, against which all
present professions are of little worth.</p>

<p>I put aside, therefore, the argument founded on the
presence of the person in question. That he still continues
in the Senate, and even challenges this inquiry,
does not prove his innocence any more than it proves
his guilt. The question is still open, to be considered
carefully, gravely, austerely, if you will, but absolutely
without passion or prejudice,&mdash;anxious only that justice
should prevail. Your decision will constitute a
precedent, important in the history of the Senate, either
as warning or encouragement to disloyalty. And since
our votes are to be recorded, I am anxious that the reasons
for mine should be known.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The question may be properly asked, if this inquiry
is to be conducted as in a court of justice, under all the
restrictions and technical rules of judicial proceedings.
Clearly not. Under the Constitution, the Senate, in a
case like the present, is absolute judge, free to exercise
its power according to its own enlightened discretion.
It may justly declare a Senator unworthy of a seat in
this body on evidence defective in form, or on evidence
even which does not constitute positive crime. A Senator
may deserve expulsion without deserving death;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
for in the one case the proceeding is to purge the Senate,
while in the other it is punishment of crime. The
motives in the two cases are widely different. This
identical discretion has been already exercised at this
very session, as well as the last, in the expulsion of several
Senators. And the two early precedents&mdash;the first
of William Blount, in 1797, and the second of John
Smith, in 1807&mdash;both proceeded on the assumption
that the Senate was at liberty to exercise a discretion
unknown to a judicial tribunal. In the well-considered
report of the Committee in the latter case, prepared by
John Quincy Adams, at that time Senator, we find the
following statement.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In examining the question, whether these forms of judicial
proceedings or the rules of judicial evidence ought to
be applied to the exercise of that censorial authority which
the Senate of the United States possesses over the conduct
of its members, let us assume, as the test of their application,
either the dictates of unfettered reason, the letter and
spirit of the Constitution, or precedents, domestic or foreign,
and your Committee believe that the result will be the same:
that the power of expelling a member must in its nature be
discretionary, and in its exercise always more summary than
the tardy process of judicial tribunals. The power of expelling
a member for misconduct results, on the principles of
common sense, from the interest of the nation that the high
trust of legislation should be invested in pure hands.”<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

</div>

<p>I do not stop to consider and illustrate a conclusion
thus sustained by precedent as well as reason.
It is obvious that the Senate may act on any evidence
satisfactory to show that one of its members is
unworthy of his seat, without bringing it to th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>e test of
any rule of law. It is true that the good name of the
individual is in question; but so also is the good name
of the Senate, not forgetting also the welfare of the
country; and if there are generous presumptions of personal
innocence, so also are there irresistible instincts of
self-defence, compelling us to act vigorously, not only
to preserve the good name of the Senate, but also to save
the country menaced by traitors.</p>

<p>Consider, too, the position of a Senator. Elected by
the Legislature of his State, he sits for six years in this
body, sharing its labors, its duties, its trusts. His official
term is the longest known to the Constitution. The
Representative, and the President himself, pass away;
but the Senator continues. In ordinary times his responsibilities
are large; but now they are larger still.
On every question of legislation, touching our multitudinous
relations, touching our finances, our army, our
navy, touching, indeed, all the issues of peace and war,&mdash;also
on every question of foreign policy, whether in
treaties or in propositions disclosed in executive session,&mdash;and
again, on all nominations by the President,
judicial, executive, military, and naval,&mdash;the Senator is
called to vote; and he is free to join in debate, and to
influence the votes of others. With these great responsibilities
are corresponding opportunities of knowledge
with regard to the counsels of the Government. These
doors are often closed against the public, but they are
never closed against him. This position of the Senator
gives to the question of his loyalty an absorbing interest.
Surely it is of no small moment to know if
there be among us any person unworthy of all this
confidence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>
<p>The facts in the present case are few, and may be
easily stated; for, beyond certain presumptions, they are
of public notoriety, and above all doubt. Indeed, the
whole case can be presented as plainly and as unanswerably
as a mathematical proposition or a diagram
in geometry.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the 6th of November of the last year, Abraham
Lincoln of Illinois was elected President by the popular
vote. The election was in every respect constitutional;
and yet, in violation of all the obligations
of the Constitution, and all the duties of patriotism,
a movement was instantly organized in the
Slave States to set aside this election, by acts of conventions,
if possible, but by violence, if necessary. The
movement began in South Carolina, a State always
mad with treason; and before the 1st of January then
next succeeding, this State formally separated from
the Union, renounced the National Government, and
ranged in open rebellion. Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi,
and Louisiana followed; and the precise object
of this rebellion was to form a new government, with
Slavery as its corner-stone. The Senators of these
States, one after another, abandoned their seats in this
Chamber, announcing a determination to seek their respective
homes, and leaving behind menaces of war,
should any attempt be made to arrest their wicked
purposes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile military preparations were commenced by
the Rebel States, who made haste to take military possession
of forts and other property belonging to the
National Government within their borders. Already,
before the 1st of January, the Palmetto flag was raised
over the custom-house and post-office at Charleston; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
was also raised over Castle Pinckney and Fort Moultrie,
in the harbor of Charleston, which, together with the
national armory, then containing many thousand stands
of arms and military stores, were occupied by Rebel
troops in the name of South Carolina. At Charleston
everything assumed the front of war. The city was
converted into a camp. The small garrison under Major
Anderson, after retreating from Fort Moultrie to Fort
Sumter, was besieged in the latter fortress. Powerful
batteries were erected to sustain the siege. From one
of these batteries, on the 9th of January, a shot was
fired at the United States steamship Star of the West,
with the national flag at her mast-head, bearing reinforcements
for the garrison, and the discomfited steamship
put back to New York. The darling desire was to capture
Fort Sumter, and various plans were devised for
this purpose. One Rebel proposed to take the fort by
floating to it rafts piled with burning tar-barrels, thus,
as was said, “attempting to smoke the American troops
out, as you would smoke a rabbit out of a hollow.” Another
was for filling bombs with prussic acid, and sending
them among the national troops. Another thought
that it might be taken without bloodshed,&mdash;through
silver, rather than shell,&mdash;simply by offering each soldier
ten dollars of Rebel money. Another proposed a
floating battery, through which, under cover of the stationary
batteries, and with the assistance of an armed
fleet, an attack might be made, while from some convenient
point a party of sharpshooters would pick off
the garrison, man by man, and thus give opportunity to
scale the walls. But such a storming, it was admitted,
could be accomplished only at a fatal sacrifice of life,
and it was finally determined that the better way was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
by protracted siege and starvation. Such, at this early
day, were the propositions discussed in Charleston, and
through the journals there advertised to the country.</p>

<p>The same spirit of rebellion, animating similar acts,
appeared in the other Rebel States. On the 3d of January,
Fort Pulaski, a fortress of considerable strength
near Savannah, was occupied by Rebel troops of Georgia,
acting under orders from the Rebel Governor. On
the 4th of January, the national arsenal at Mobile,
with arms, barrels of powder, and other munitions of
war, was seized by Rebel troops of Alabama, as was
also Fort Morgan on the same day. On the 11th
of January, the marine hospital, two miles below New
Orleans, was seized by Rebel troops of Louisiana, and
the patients of the hospital, numbering two hundred
and sixteen, were ordered away to make quarters for
the Rebels,&mdash;thus repeating the indefensible atrocity
of Napoleon, when, near Dresden, he seized an insane
asylum for his troops, and set its inmates loose,
saying, “Turn out the mad.”<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> On the 12th of January,
Fort Barrancas and the navy-yard at Pensacola,
with all their ordnance stores, were obliged to surrender
to armed Rebels of Florida and Alabama, the commandant
reporting to the National Government, “Having
no means of resistance, I surrendered, and hauled
down my flag.” On the 24th of January, the national
arsenal at Augusta, in Georgia, also surrendered,
upon demand of the Rebel Governor. On the 31st of
January, the national branch mint, containing $389,000,
and the national sub-treasury, containing $122,000, were
seized at New Orleans by the Rebel authorities. Such,
most briefly told, are some of the positive incidents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> of
actual war through which the Rebellion became manifest.
And you also know, that, throughout the anxious
period, when these things were occurring, the National
Capital was menaced by the Rebels, proposing
especially to disperse Congress, to drive away the National
Government, and to seize the National Archives.
Nor can you forget that Lieutenant-General Scott, then
at the head of our army, under the exigencies of the
time, changed his head-quarters from New York to
Washington, where he gave his best powers to the
national defence,&mdash;organizing the local militia, summoning
the national troops, planting cannon, and in
every way preparing to meet the threatened danger.</p>

<p>Meanwhile these Rebel States, having declared their
separation from the National Government and forcibly
seized its strongholds and other property within their
borders, proceeded to constitute themselves into a political
conglomerate, under the title of Confederate States.
Their Constitution was adopted on the 8th of February,
and the same day Jefferson Davis, of Mississippi, was
elected President and commander-in-chief of the armies,
and Alexander H. Stephens, of Georgia, Vice-President.
Shortly afterwards, on the 21st of February, the President
of the Rebellion nominated a Cabinet, in which Toombs,
of Georgia, was Secretary of State, Memminger, of South
Carolina, Secretary of the Treasury, and Walker, of Alabama,
Secretary of War. To this extent had the Rebellion
gone. No longer a mere conspiracy, no longer
a simple purpose, no longer a mere outbreak, it was
an organized body, or rather several organized bodies
massed into one, and affecting the character and substance
of government. Remember, too, that in all its
doings and pretensions it was a Rebel governm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>ent, set
in motion by conspiracy and sustained by declared Rebellion,
which openly disowned the National Government,
openly seized the national forts, and openly dishonored
the national flag. Of this flagrant Rebellion
Jefferson Davis became the chosen chief, as he had already
been for a long time the animating spirit. In
him the Rebellion was incarnate. He was not merely
its civil head, but its military head also. It was he who
made cabinets, commanded armies, and gathered munitions
of war. His voice and his hand were voice and
hand of the Rebellion itself. By his own eminent participation,
and the superadded choice of the Rebels,
he had become its chief, as much as the old Pretender
was chief of the disastrous Rebellion in Great Britain,
crushed on the field of Culloden,&mdash;as much as Satan
himself, when seated on his throne and rallying his
peers of state, was chief of an earlier rebellion.</p>

<p>That transcendent outrage, in itself the culmination
of the Rebellion, destined to arouse at last a forbearing
people, had not yet occurred; but it was at hand. Fort
Sumter had not been openly assailed; but the hostile
batteries were ready, and the hostile guns were pointed,
simply waiting the word of Rebel command, not yet
given.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Precisely at this moment, on the 1st of March, 1861,
Jesse D. Bright, at the time a Senator of the United
States, addressed the following letter to the chief of the
Rebellion.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium">“<span class="smcap">Washington</span>, March 1, 1861.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Allow me to introduce to your acquaintance
my friend Thomas B. Lincoln, of Texas. He visits
your capital mainly to dispose of what he regards a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>improvement in fire-arms. I commend him to your favorable
consideration, as a gentleman of the first respectability, and
reliable in every respect.</p>

<p class="sig">“Very truly yours,</p>

<p class="sig2">“<span class="smcap">Jesse D. Bright</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent medium">“To His Excellency, <span class="smcap">Jefferson Davis</span>,<br />
“<i>President of the Confederation of States</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>And now, before considering the letter, look well at
the parties and their respective positions. It is written
by a person at the time Senator, and addressed to a
person at the time chief of the Rebellion, in behalf of
an unknown citizen, owner of a great improvement in
fire-arms. It is proper to mention, as additional facts
which will not be questioned, that the author had been
for a long time in notorious personal relations with the
conspicuous authors of the Rebellion, especially with
Jefferson Davis and John Slidell,&mdash;that he had notoriously
sympathized with them in those barbarous pretensions
for Slavery which constitute the Origin and
Mainspring of the Rebellion,&mdash;and that he had always
voted with them in the Senate. All this is notorious;
and if the old maxim, <i>Noscitur a sociis</i>, or, according to
our familiar English, “A man is known by the company
he keeps,” be not entirely obsolete, then this inquiry
must commence with a presumption against such an
intimate associate of the Rebels. But, while looking at
the author, we must not forget the humble citizen intrusted
with the letter. It is a fact, as I understand,
that he has been since arrested for treason, and is now
in the hands of the law, charged with the highest crime
known to justice, while the author still occupies a seat
in the Senate. Perhaps this is only another illustration
of the saying of Antiquity, that the law is a cobweb,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
holding the weak, but which the powerful break through
with impunity. The agent is now in custody; the principal
is yet in the Senate. So much at present with regard
to the parties.</p>

<p>Next comes the letter itself. And here mark, if you
please, first, the date, which is the 1st of March. This
was at the very moment when the Rebellion was completely
organized, and had assumed at all points the
undisguised front of war. By various acts of violence
it had forcibly dispossessed the National Government of
all its military posts in the whole extensive region, except
Fort Sumter and Fort Pickens, which it held in
siege,&mdash;while, by other formal acts, it had assumed to
dispossess the National Government of all jurisdiction,
civil or military, throughout this region. That such
acts constituted “levying of war,” within the meaning
of the Constitution, is too plain for argument. This
phrase, borrowed from the early statute of Edward the
Third, has received positive interpretation in the country
of its origin, according to which its meaning is clear.
There is no better authority than Sir William Blackstone,
who, when considering what is “levying of war,”
says: “This may be done by taking arms, not only to
dethrone the king, but under pretence to reform religion
or the laws, or to remove evil counsellors, or other grievances,
whether real or pretended: for the law does not,
neither can it, permit any private man or set of men to
interfere forcibly in matters of such high importance.”<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
And Lord Mansfield, Chief-Justice of England, on the
trial of Lord George Gordon, declared it to be “the
unanimous opinion of the Court, that an attempt, by
intimidation and violence, to force the repeal of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> law,
was a levying war against the king, and high treason.”<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
I quote these authorities simply that this statement
may not rest at any point on my assertion. At the
date of this letter, then, there was actual levying of
war by Jefferson Davis and his associates against the
Government of the United States. And let me add,
that this levying of war was not merely that moderate
constructive levying of war described by Blackstone,
but open, earnest, positive war, backed by armies and
by batteries.</p>

<p>You will next observe the address of this letter. It
is “To His Excellency, Jefferson Davis, President of the
Confederation of States.” Bestowing upon this Pretender
the title of “His Excellency,” the author certainly
exhibits a courtesy&mdash;at least in form&mdash;which usage
does not allow the President of the United States. It is
well known, that, at the organization of the Government,
the title of “Excellency,” together with all other titles,
was, after debate, carefully rejected for our Chief Magistrate;
but the author of this treasonable letter will not
deny anything to the Chief of the Rebellion. His profusion
appears at once, and his first words become a
confession. Not by titles of courtesy do loyal Senators
address a traitor. There has been a King of England
who on one occasion was called only Charles Stuart, and
there has been a King of France who on one occasion
was called only Louis Capet; and these great instances
show how even the loftiest and most established titles
are refused, where treason is in question. Titles are
sometimes insincere; but a title voluntarily bestowed
testifies at least to the professions of him who bestows
it. It is a token of respect, and an invitation to good-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>will,
proceeding directly from the author. And in this
spirit was this letter begun.</p>

<p>Not content with bestowing upon this Pretender a title
of courtesy denied to our own President, the author
proceeds to bestow upon him a further title of office and
of power. He addresses him as “President of the Confederation
of States,”&mdash;meaning the very States then
engaged in levying war upon the National Government.
So far as this author can go, just to the extent of his
authority, the Pretender is recognized as President, and
the Rebel States are described by the very title which,
in defiance of the National Government, they assume.
Our own Government steadfastly refuses this recognition.
Foreign nations thus far follow substantially the
policy of our own Government; but the author of this
letter, at the time Senator, makes haste to offer recognition.</p>

<p>Perhaps this double criticism on the address of the
letter may seem unimportant. It might be so, if the
address had been used in conversation or debate, although
then it would be tolerable only if used in derision.
But it becomes important, when used directly to
the Pretender himself; for then it signifies respect and
recognition, while it discloses the mood of the author.</p>

<p>Look next at the contents, or the letter itself, and all
that is implied in the address you will find painfully
verified. The disloyalty which crops out in titles of
courtesy and recognition becomes full-blown in the letter
itself, whether we regard its general character or
its special import; and I shall now consider these in
their order.</p>

<p>In general character the letter is correspondence with
a public enemy, in open war with our own country; or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
rather let me say it is correspondence with a public
rebel. It is obvious that all correspondence of such a
character, even without considering its special import,
is open to suspicion. Throughout history it has been
watched with jealous judgment, as in the cases of Bolingbroke
and Atterbury in England, of Pichegru and
Fouché in France. Tried even by those technical rules
which in the present inquiry we reject, it may help
to complete the evidence of treason itself. The well-chosen
language of the Constitution, borrowed from
an early resolution of the Continental Congress, by
whom it was borrowed from the early English statute,
authorizes this conclusion. According to the Constitution,
“Treason against the United States shall consist
only in levying war against them, or in adhering to
their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.” Here
are two classes of cases: the first is levying war, which
Jefferson Davis, as we have already seen, was notoriously
doing at the date of this letter; and the second
is adhering to enemies, giving them aid and comfort.
Even if mere correspondence with an enemy would not
bring the author within the scope of these words, clearly
and beyond all question such correspondence is calculated
to give at least moral aid and comfort to the enemy.
Nor is it to be disregarded on this occasion, even
if it does not reach the technical requirement of treason.
If we listen to the Supreme Court of the United
States in the case of Bollman, we find this tribunal
declaring, that, “if war be actually levied, that is, if a
body of men be actually assembled for the purpose of
effecting by force a treasonable purpose, <em>all those who
perform any part, however minute, or however remote
from the scene of action</em>, and who are actually leagued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
in the general conspiracy, are to be considered as traitors.”<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
Assuming the previous league, it cannot be
doubted that an act of sympathy and friendship, though
minute or remote, extended to persons in rebellion,
would be evidence to bring the offender within the
cautious grasp of the Constitution, even on technical
grounds. If in the present case there was no previous
league, there was at least a previous and most notorious
fellowship, kindred to a league, by which the author
was morally linked to the conspirators.</p>

<p>But the letter in question is a letter of sympathy and
friendship, from beginning to end,&mdash;such a letter as
only one friend could write to another friend. Dated at
Washington on the 1st of March, it was calculated, if
received by the Pretender, to give him hope and confidence,
by inspiring the idea that here in the Senate
Chamber there was at least one person still wearing
this high trust, who, forgetting all that was due to his
country, and forgetting all that was due to the Rebellion,
reached forth his hand in friendly salutation. Dated
at Washington on the 1st of March, it was calculated,
if received, to awaken doubt of the loyalty of the Senate
itself, and to encourage belief that here, in this
sanctuary of the Constitution, treason might hatch undisturbed.
So are we all knit together, that we are
strengthened by human sympathy; and the Pretender
would have felt new vigor, as the strength of the American
Senate was transfused through the declared sympathies
of an acknowledged member. The patriot soul
recoils from the ancient traitor who flashed a signal
torch from a beleaguered citadel; but one of our own
number, who yet sits among us, has done this very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
thing.</p>

<p>Such is the necessary conclusion with regard to this
letter, if we look at its general character. But when
we consider its special import, the conclusion is still
more irresistible. The letter clearly comes within the
precise text of the Constitution. It is flat treason. I
use no soft words, for the occasion does not allow it.
Adhering to the enemy, giving them aid and comfort,
must be proved by some overt act, of which Blackstone
states the following instances: “As by giving them intelligence,
by sending them provisions, <em>by selling them
arms</em>, by treacherously surrendering a fortress, <em>or the
like</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Such are precise words of this authority, and
I do not stop to enforce them. But this letter is an
overt act of adherence, giving aid and comfort, identical
with the instances mentioned by Blackstone. Read
it. “Allow me to introduce to your acquaintance,” so
says the letter, “<em>my friend</em> Thomas B. Lincoln, of
Texas.” The bearer of the letter is commended as a
friend of the writer: but a friend is something more
than associate or confederate; he is almost part of one’s
self. Thus accredited, his errand is next announced:
“He visits <em>your capital</em> mainly to dispose of what he
regards a great improvement in fire-arms.” Mark the
words “your capital.” Such is the language of an
American Senator, writing to the Pretender, whose
standard of Rebellion was then flying at Montgomery,
in Alabama, which is thus deferentially designated as
<em>his</em> capital. Observe next the declared object of the
visit. It is “to dispose of what he regards a great
improvement in fire-arms.” Thus does an American
Senator send actual, open, unequivocal aid to th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>e Chief
of the Rebellion. It is true, he does not send him
rifles or cannon; but he sends him “a great improvement
in fire-arms,” through which rifles and cannon
and other instruments of death, then preparing to be
employed by Rebel hands against the patriot armies
of the Republic, might be made more deadly. What
are a few rifles, or a few cannon, by the side of such a
comprehensive gift? When France, through the disguised
agency of a successful dramatist,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> sent ordnance
and muskets to our Revolutionary fathers, she mixed
herself positively in the contest, and, under the Law
of Nations, Great Britain was justified in regarding her
conduct as an act of war. And when an American
Senator, without disguise, sends “a great improvement
in fire-arms” to the Rebel chief, then engaged in levying
war against his country, he mixes himself in the
Rebellion, so that under Municipal Law he is a traitor.
This conclusion is harsh, and I state it painfully; but
it is according to the irresistible logic of the law and
the facts.</p>

<p>But the letter contains other language to aggravate
its guilt. Not content with sending the “great improvement
in fire-arms,” the bearer is thus accredited
to the Rebel chief: “I commend him to your favorable
consideration, as a gentleman of the first respectability,
and reliable in every respect.” An American
citizen going forth on an errand of treason is thus
exalted by an American Senator. The open traitor
is announced as “a gentleman of the first respectability.”
This is much to say of anybody; it is too
much to say of an open traitor. But he is “reliable in
every respect.” All language is to be con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>strued with
reference to the matter which it concerns. The bearer
of this letter, going forth on an errand of treason, is
“reliable in every respect”; and as the universal contains
the special, he is reliable especially for the purposes
of his treason: and this is the commendation
which he bears to the Rebel chief from an American
Senator.</p>

<p>Such a letter naturally begins, “My dear Sir,”&mdash;for
the Chief of the Rebellion is evidently dear to the
writer. That such a letter should be signed, “Very
truly yours, Jesse D. Bright,” is natural also, and the
words are not mere form. The author evidently, according
to the contents of the letter,&mdash;as appears alike in
its general character and its special import,&mdash;belongs
to the Rebel chief, and is one of his “own.” In writing
to the Rebel chief, he honestly begins, “My dear
Sir,” and honestly closes, “Very truly yours”; but a
person thus beginning and thus closing a letter of treason,
volunteered to the declared enemy of his country,
can hardly expect welcome to the confidential duties of
this body.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of course, in this inquiry, I assume the genuineness
of the letter. If this letter were to be considered on
technical grounds, the evidence would not be disdained
even under the conservative words of our Constitution,
according to which “no person shall be convicted of
treason, unless on the testimony of two witnesses to
the same overt act, <em>or on confession in open court</em>.” We
have had the confession of the writer in open Senate,
following similar confession in a supplementary letter,
to which reference has been made in this debate. There
can be no doubt on this point, and the writer must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
stand or fall by this letter, unless something has occurred
since which can be accepted in extenuation of
the unfortunate transaction.</p>

<p>It is true that the bearer of the letter was not able to
present it. Before consummating his errand of treason,
he was arrested by the watchful officers of the law, and,
as we have already seen, is now in custody. The agent
is in the hands of the law, while we debate on the seat
of his principal. At the risk of introducing a superfluous
topic, I cannot forbear adding that the crime of the
principal was perfect when he wrote the letter and
delivered it to his agent. It was expressly decided in
England long ago, that a treasonable communication,
“though intercepted, is an overt act of treason”; and
this early principle was repeated by the Court of King’s
Bench, speaking by the voice of Lord Mansfield, in the
case of Dr. Hensey,<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> and again by the same court, under
Lord Kenyon, in the case of William Stone.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> It is
completely applicable to the present case, even if our
inquiry proceeded on technical grounds.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But the history of the transaction is not yet complete.
Other incidents have occurred since, which are strangely
offered in extenuation of the original crime. At the
arrest of the agent, towards the close of last summer,
the letter was found among his papers. Of course it
excited much attention and some feeling. This was
natural. At last the author, who still sits among us,
addressed a second letter to his late colleague in this
body [Mr. <span class="smcap">Fitch</span>].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Bright</span> (<i>from his seat</i>). It was not to my late colleague;
it was to another Mr. Fitch.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Very well. The letter, dated “At my
Farm, September 7, 1861,” proceeds as follows: “The
letter to which you refer is no doubt genuine. I have
no recollection of writing it; but if Mr. Lincoln,” the
bearer of the letter, “says I did, then I am entirely
satisfied of the fact; for I am quite sure I would have
given, as a matter of course, just such a letter of introduction
to any friend who had asked it.” Thus, as late
as the 7th of September, in the retirement of his farm,
the original letter was approved and sanctioned. I
would not exaggerate the effect of this second letter, as
I need not exaggerate any point in this unhappy case;
but, in view of the character of the original letter, the
second letter can only be considered as marking either
stolid hardihood of guilt or stolid insensibility to those
rules of duty without which no man can be a good citizen;
but either way, it only adds to the offensive character
of the original transaction, and makes the duty of
the Senate more plain.</p>

<p>I do not dwell on other topics of this second letter,
because, though exhibiting bad temper and bad principles,
they do not necessarily conduct to treason. The
author is welcome to express “utter contempt for Abolitionism,”
and also to declare his early and constant
opposition to what he calls “the entire coercive policy
of the Government.” Such declarations may render
him an unsafe counsellor, but they do not stamp him
as traitor. And it belongs to us, while purging this
body of disloyalty in all its forms, to maintain at all
hazards that freedom of speech which is herald and
safeguard of all other freedom.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>
<p>There is other testimony which aggravates the case
still further. Not content with writing the traitorous
letter, on the 1st of March, 1861, not content with approving
and sanctioning this letter on the 7th of September,
the author very recently rose in the place yet
conceded to him in this Chamber, and deliberately
said: “I have done nothing that I would not do over
again under the same circumstances, and that I am
not prepared to defend here or elsewhere.”<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> These
words were uttered on this floor, in debate on another
case which occurred as late as the 7th of January of
this year. Thus was the original act of the 1st of
March again affirmed, and the relations existing at
that time with the Rebel chief proclaimed and vindicated;
and all this in the American Senate, without
a blush. Alas for that sensitive virtue which is
the grace and strength alike of individuals and of communities!
Surely it was wanting in him who could
thus brave a just judgment: I fear it was wanting
also in ourselves, when he was permitted to go without
instant rebuke.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But I hear the suggestion, that at the date of this
letter war was not yet flagrant, and that the author did
not anticipate an actual conflict of arms. The first part
of this suggestion is notoriously false. War had already
begun, in the seizure of forts, and in the muster of Rebel
armies; nay, more, in the very presence of the author,
the gage of battle was flung down on this floor by Senators
leaving to take part in the Rebellion. This has
been unanswerably shown by the Senator from Minnesota
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Wilkinson</span>]. But the second part of the
suggestion attributes to the author an ignorance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
well-known condition of things, inconsistent with his
acknowledged intelligence. If the progress and development
of the Rebellion had been in secret, if it had
been masked by an impenetrable privacy, if it had been
shrouded in congenial darkness, then this apology might
be entitled to attention. But the Rebellion was open
and complete; and on the 1st of March it was armed
from head to foot, and in battle array against the National
Government. Such was the actual condition of
things, patent, certain, conspicuous to the whole country.
And permit me to say that any apology now offered
on pretext of ignorance shows simply a disposition
to evade a just responsibility at any hazard of personal
character.</p>

<p>I note the further suggestion, that the letter was
written in carelessness, or in heedlessness, if you please,
and without treasonable intent. Of course such a suggestion
must be futile; for every man is presumed to
know the natural consequences of his conduct. This is
the rule of law, and the rule of patriotism. No man
can be admitted to set up any carelessness or heedlessness
as apology for treason. And I doubt not you will
all agree with me, that a patriot Senator cannot be careless
or heedless, when his country is in peril.</p>

<p>But I catch yet another suggestion, that this letter is
trivial and insignificant to justify the condemnation of
a Senator. Then, indeed, is disloyalty trivial; then is
treason itself trivial. It is true, the letter is curt; it
contains a single short paragraph only; but I have yet
to learn that crime is measured by paragraphs or sentences,
and that treason may not be found in a few
words as well as in many. True, also, the letter is
familiar in tone; but treason is a subtle wickednes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>s,
which sometimes stalks in state and sometimes shuffles
in homely disguise. It is our duty to detect and to
judge it, whatever form it takes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. President, let me not be unjust,&mdash;let me not lean
even ungently against an offender; but you will pardon
me, if I add, that against precise testimony, and in
the face of unquestioned facts, I can find little in any
present professions of loyalty to be accepted even in
extenuation of the offence. The duty of the Senate
depends upon former conduct, and not upon present
professions. It is difficult to imagine any present professions
which can restore the confidence essential to
the usefulness of a Senator. It is in the hour of trial
and doubt that men show themselves as they are, laying
up for the future weal or woe,&mdash;and not afterwards,
when all temptation to disloyalty is lost in the
assured danger it must encounter, and when all positions
have become fixed by events. Nor do I forget
that mere professions have too often been a cover for
falsehood. I refer again to the story of Benedict Arnold.
After making his escape from the fort which
he was about to betray, and finding shelter on board
the British frigate, the Vulture, then swimming in the
North River, he addressed a letter to General Washington,
which begins as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium">“<span class="smcap">On board the Vulture</span>, 25 September, 1780.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>:&mdash;The heart which is conscious of its own rectitude
cannot attempt to palliate a step which the world may censure
as wrong. I have ever acted from a principle of love
to my country, since the commencement of the present unhappy
contest between Great Britain and the Colonies: the
same principle of love to my country actuates my present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>conduct, however it may appear inconsistent to the world,
who very seldom judge right of any man’s actions.”<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Perhaps these very words might now be repeated
by the person whose seat is in question. He may not
fancy being classed with Benedict Arnold; but the professions
of that fugitive traitor are identical with the
professions to which we have listened on this floor.
There is still another letter to General Washington
from the same quarter, only a few days later, that is
equally suggestive. Arnold protests against the arrest
and impending execution of Major André, who, he says,
acted under his directions, and his promise of protection;
and he adds, “As commanding officer in the
department, I had an undoubted right to transact all
these matters,”<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>&mdash;precisely as the person whose seat
is in question avers in letter and debate that he had
undoubted right to open that traitorous correspondence
with the Chief of the Rebellion. But I proceed no further
with this parallel.</p>

<p>Sir, if the present question were to be decided on
grounds of sympathy, it would be pleasant to record
our names so as to give the least personal pain. But
we should act weakly and ignobly, if on any such
ground we failed in the double duty now so urgent,&mdash;first,
to the Senate, of which we are members, and next,
to that country which has a right to our truest and
most unhesitating devotion. If there be among us any
person still enjoying the confidential trusts, legislative,
diplomatic, and executive, of this Chamber, who, since
Rebellion hoisted its flag and pointed its cannon, has
failed in that loyalty which is an inviolable obligati<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>on,&mdash;even
though his offence may not have the deepest
dye of treason,&mdash;he is unworthy of a seat in the Senate;
and be assured, Sir, that our country, which knows
so well how to pardon all that is pardonable, expects
that no such person, whatever his present professions,
shall be recognized any longer as Senator.</p>

<p>Do not hesitate, then. The case is clear, and impartial
history will so record it. No argument, no
apology, no extenuation can remove or mitigate its requirements.
There is a courage which belongs to this
peaceful Chamber as much as to the battle-field, and
now is the occasion for it. Above all, let no false
tenderness substitute sympathy for judgment; and remember
well, that, while casting out a faithless Senator,
you will elevate the Senate and inspire the country.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sumner was followed on the same day by Mr. Lane, of Indiana,
colleague of Mr. Bright, and then by Mr. Bright himself, who was especially
bitter in allusion to him, alleging personal difference as the
motive of his conduct. Mr. Sumner replied at once to this imputation.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;The Senator from Indiana [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Bright</span>], in the speech he has just made, referred to
his personal relations with myself, and intimated, if
he did not charge, that there had been some personal
question or difference between us. Sir,&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Bright.</span> Mr. President,&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Excuse me.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Bright.</span> I intimated no such thing, Sir.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Let me finish. Sir, that is not the
fact. Since I have been a member of this body, now
more than ten years, it has been my fortune to mix in
the debates on important public questions. On these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
occasions I have encountered, as the record shows, the
opposition of that Senator, and of his constant associates
in this body, all of them now in open rebellion. With
the Senator and his constant associates I never had
personal question or difference. Therefore, when the
Senator asserts any such thing, or suggests it, he goes
entirely beyond the record, and I could not allow the
debate to close to-night without interposing my positive
denial.</p>

<p>Sir, I have approached this painful question free
from all personal prejudice. I have no feeling against
the Senator. There has been nothing in our past relations
to turn the scales by a feather’s weight.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The speech of Mr. Bright, to which allusion is made, does not appear
in the official report. It was taken down and written out by the reporters,
and then submitted to Mr. Bright, who never returned the
manuscript. At the proper place in the <i>Congressional Globe</i>,<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> where
the speech should be, is the following: “Mr. Bright next addressed
the Senate. [His speech will be published in the Appendix.]” It is
not found in the Appendix, which is explained by the following in the
Index for the Session, under the name of <span class="smcap">Jesse D. Bright</span>: “The
manuscript of the speech referred to on page 418 was retained by
Mr. B.” So that the speech was suppressed by him.</p>

<p>February 4th, after several others had spoken, Mr. Sumner spoke
again as follows.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;This debate is about to close; but
before the vote is taken I wish briefly to review it, and
to show again that there is but one conclusion which
can truly satisfy the Senate or the country. If your
last judgment in this case were not of incalculable
importance both for the Senate and the country, helping
to elevate the one and to inspire the other, I
should not venture again to claim your attenti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>on.
Such a precedent, so fruitful in good influences, should
be completely commended and vindicated, that it may
remain forever a commanding example.</p>

<p>Among all who have spoken, we naturally yield
precedence on this occasion to the Senator from Indiana
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Bright</span>]. His speech was not long, but it
afforded ample ground for regret, if not for condemnation.
It showed offensively the same spirit which is
found in the original letter; nor did it suggest anything
in apology, except that the bearer of the letter was his
lifelong friend, and that, when writing the letter, he
did not dream of war: in other words, an act of unquestionable
disloyalty was put under the double cloak
of lifelong friendship and professed ignorance. The real
condition of things was not noticed, while he sought
to serve a friend. Because the bearer of the letter was
his lifelong friend, and because the Senator did not see
war ahead, therefore he was justified in sending forth
this lifelong friend on an errand of disloyalty, ay, of
treason itself, and of making him the instrument of aid
and comfort to an organized rebellion. Of course such
an argument shows weakness, and not strength; and
the very weakness out of which it sprung naturally
became impassioned and unjust. If any personal feeling
could disturb that perfect equanimity which with
me, on this occasion, is a sentiment and a duty, I
might complain of that vindictive tone which broke
forth, not only in personal imputation, but also in
menace that what I said on the case of the Senator I
dared not say again here or elsewhere; but I make no
complaint. It is sufficient for me that I spoke in the
conscious discharge of duty, and that I know of nothing
in the vindictive tone or in the menace of the Senator<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
that can interfere with such duty, as I understand it.
Therefore I put aside what he has said, whether of personal
imputation, or of personal menace, or of argument;
for they all leave him worse than if he had continued
silent.</p>

<p>I put aside also the elaborate argument, lasting for
more than a whole day, of the Senator from Kentucky
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>], practically exalting Slavery above the
Constitution, and, while life is sacrificed and property
is taken, while great rights are trodden down and all
human energies are enlisted in defence of our country,
insisting that Slavery alone is too sacred to be touched.
Sir, I put aside this argument, because it is utterly out
of place and irrelevant; and I trust it is not my habit
in debate to ramble from that straight line which is
the shortest way to the desired point. There is a time
to sow and a time to reap; and there will be a time to
discuss the constitutional power of Congress to end this
Rebellion, even if, in so doing, it is constrained to end
Slavery itself.</p>

<p>I put aside, also, the suggestion of the Senator from
New York [Mr. <span class="smcap">Harris</span>], to the effect that the Senator
from Indiana is now on trial, that our proceedings are
judicial, and that the evidence before us is insufficient
to satisfy the requirements of such a case. Surely this
assumption proceeds on a mistake. The Senator from
Indiana is not on trial, in the ordinary understanding of
that term; nor are our proceedings judicial; nor is the
evidence insufficient for the case. Under the Constitution,
each House, with the concurrence of two thirds,
may expel a member; but this large discretionary power
is given simply for the protection of the body in the
exercise of an honest and honorable self-defence. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Senate itself is on trial just as much as the Senator;
and permit me to say that the Senate will condemn itself,
if it allow any person to continue among its members
who has forfeited that peculiar confidence in his
loyalty which is essential to his usefulness as Senator.
It is vain to say that the evidence is insufficient. Technically
and judicially it may be so; but according to all
legislative precedents and all the rules of common life
it is obviously sufficient, for it is beyond all practical
doubt. My friend from New York did not hesitate at
this session to vote for the expulsion of Breckinridge, of
Polk, and of Johnson, without one scrap of evidence
that he would recognize as a judge on the bench. How
can he require evidence now which he did not require
then?</p>

<p>I put aside, also, the argument of the Senator from
Pennsylvania [Mr. <span class="smcap">Cowan</span>], so carefully and elaborately
stated, to the effect that on the 1st of March, when the
disloyal letter was written, there was no war actually
existing between the Rebel States and the United States.
Even if this assumption were correct, even if the United
States were still hesitating what course to adopt,
nothing is clearer than this: the Rebel States were in
rebellion,&mdash;organized, armed, and offensive,&mdash;with the
avowed purpose of overthrowing the National Government
within their borders; and such rebellion was, beyond
all question, a levying of war under the Constitution
of the United States, so that all adherence to it,
giving aid and comfort, was treason itself. But even if
not disposed to admit actual levying of war on the part
of the Rebels,&mdash;though of this there can be no doubt,&mdash;there
was surely preparation and purpose so to do;
and any contribution to such preparation and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> purpose
was disloyalty, if not treason. Clearly, Jefferson Davis
at that time was a traitor, at the head of traitors. What,
then, can be thought of a Senator who offered arms to
him?</p>

<p>I put aside, also, the suggestion of the Senator from
New Jersey [Mr. <span class="smcap">Ten Eyck</span>], founded on the language
of the President in his inaugural address of the 4th of
March. It is true that the President spoke of the Rebels
in generous, fraternal words, such as became the Chief
Magistrate of a great people, not yet renouncing the
idea of conquering by kindness, and not forgetting that
Leviathan was tamed by a cord. But, whatever the
language of the President, it is none the less clear that
the Rebellion at that very moment was completely organized
by a succession of overt acts, which fixed the
treasonable position of its authors, and especially of its
chief, to whom the letter offering arms was addressed.</p>

<p>I put aside, also, the argument of the Senator from
California [Mr. <span class="smcap">Latham</span>], especially that part founded
on the tolerance shown to treason, when uttered here by
the retiring Rebels. Nobody questions that treason was
uttered on this floor, or that treasonable counsels went
forth from this Chamber. But the Senate was then
controlled by the associates of the Senator of Indiana,
and it was not in our power to check or chastise the
traitors. It is within the recollection of many that
those utterances were heard on this side of the Chamber,
not only with indignant patriotism, but with bitter,
stinging regret at the abject condition of the Senate,
then so entirely in the hands of traitors that we were
obliged to hear in silence. Surely such utterances,
wicked with treason, constituting the very voice of
the Rebellion, cannot be an apology for the disloyal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
letter of the Senator; nor can silence, when we were
powerless to act, be any argument for silence now that
power and responsibility are ours.</p>

<p>I agree with the Senator from Illinois [Mr. <span class="smcap">Browning</span>],
that the whole conduct and declaration of the
author may be legitimately employed to elucidate the
character of this letter; but I found no supplementary
charge on such conduct or declaration. Others may
use the argument that the Senator has declared himself
against coercion of the Rebel States, or that he has refused
to vote the necessary means for the suppression
of the Rebellion; but I use no such argument. Much
as I lament such a course, and justly obnoxious as
I regard it, yet I cannot consider it as an argument
for expulsion of the Senator. Freedom of debate is
among the triumphs of modern civilization; and it
shall never be impaired by any vote or word of mine.
To this freedom I have held fast, when almost alone in
this body; and what I have steadily vindicated for
myself against all odds I shall never deny to another.
Therefore, if I am the judge, there is no Senator who
will not always be perfectly free to speak and vote
as he thinks best on every question that shall legitimately
arise; but beyond this immunity he must not
go. He shall not talk treason; he shall not parley with
rebellion; he shall not address to it words of sympathy
and good-will; especially, he shall not recognize its
chief in his pretended character of President, nor shall
he send him improved fire-arms to be employed in the
work of treason.</p>

<p>Putting aside all these considerations, the case against
the Senator from Indiana is clear. All apologies, all
excuses, utterly fail. It is vain to say that the bearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
of the letter was his lifelong friend, as it is vain to say,
also, that the Senator did not dream that there would
be war. The first apology is as feeble as the second is
audacious. If the Senator did not dream that there
would be war, then why send arms to the chief of the
Rebellion? To Jefferson Davis as a private citizen, to
Jefferson Davis as a patriot Senator, there was no occasion
or motive for sending arms. It was only to Jefferson
Davis as chief of the Rebellion that arms could be
sent; and to him, in that character, they were sent.
But even if the Rebellion were not at that time manifest
in overt acts,&mdash;as it clearly was,&mdash;still the sending
of arms was a positive provocation and contribution
to its outbreak, especially when the arms were sent by
a Senator. And now, at the risk of repetition, I say
again, it is not necessary that the war should have been
commenced on the part of the United States. It is
enough, that, on the part of Jefferson Davis, at the date
of the letter, there was actual levying of war, or, at least,
a purpose to levy war; and in either of these two cases,
the latter as well as the former, the guilt of the Senator
offering arms is complete,&mdash;call it treason, or simply
disloyalty, if you will.</p>

<p>It is vain that you seek to surround the Senatorial
letter-writer with the technical defences of a judicial
tribunal. This will not do. They are out of place.
God grant, that, in the administration of justice, a citizen
arraigned for his life may always be presumed innocent
till he is proved guilty! But, while zealously
asserting this presumption in a criminal trial, I utterly
deny it in the present case. The two proceedings are
radically unlike. In the one we think most of the
individual; in the other we think most of the Sen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>ate.
The flag-officer of a fleet, or the commander of a garrison,
when only suspected of correspondence with the
enemy, is without delay deprived of command; nor can
any technical presumption of innocence be invoked in
his defence. For the sake of the fleet, for the sake of
the garrison, which must not be betrayed, it is your duty
to see that he is deprived of command. Nor can a suspected
Senator, with all his confidential trusts, legislative,
diplomatic, and executive, expect any tolerance
denied to a suspected flag-officer, or to a suspected commander
of a garrison. If not strong, pure, and upright
in himself, he must not expect to find strength, purity,
and uprightness in any presumption of innocence, or in
any technical rule of law. For the sake of the Senate,
he must be deprived of his place. Afterwards, should
he be arraigned at law, he will be allowed to employ
all the devices and weapons familiar to judicial proceedings.</p>

<p>There is another illusion into which the Senator
has fallen; and it seems to me that the Senator from
New York, and perhaps other Senators, have followed
him. It is the assumption, that, in depriving the Senator
of his seat, we take from him something that is
really his. This is a mistake. A Senator is simply a
trustee. The Senator is trustee for Indiana. But his
fidelity as trustee is now drawn in question; and
since no person is allowed to continue as trustee whose
character is not above suspicion,&mdash;inspired <i>uberrimâ
fide</i>, according to the language of the law,&mdash;the case
of the Senator should obviously be remanded to the
State for which he still assumes to act. Should he be
wronged by expulsion, then will that State promptly
return him to his present trust, and our judgment will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
be generously reversed. The Senator has no right for
himself here; he does not represent himself; but he
represents his State, of which he is the elected, most
confidential trustee; and when his fidelity is openly
impeached, there is no personal right which can become
his shield. Tell me not of the seat of the Senator.
Let the Senator be cautious in language. By
courtesy the seat may be his; but in reality the seat
belongs to Indiana; and this honored State, unsurpassed
in contributions to the patriot armies of the Republic,
may justly protest against longer misrepresentation on
this floor by a disloyal Senator.</p>

<p>But the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. <span class="smcap">Cowan</span>] exclaims&mdash;and
the Senator from New York follows him&mdash;that
the offence of the Senator is “treason or nothing.”
For myself, I have no hesitation in expressing
the conviction that it is treason. If it be not treason in
a Senator to send arms to an open traitor, whom he at
the same time acknowledges in his traitorous character,
then it were better to blot out the crime of treason
from our statute-book, and to rase its definition from
the Constitution. Sir, it is treason. But even if not
treason according to all the technical requirements of
that crime, obviously and unquestionably it is an act of
disloyalty so discreditable, so unworthy, and so dangerous
as to render the duty of the Senate imperative. Is
it nothing that the Senator should write a friendly letter,
make open acknowledgment, and offer warlike aid to a
public traitor? Is it nothing, that, sitting in this Chamber,
the Senator should send to the chief of the Rebellion
words of sympathy and arms of power? Is it
nothing that the Senator should address the traitor in
terms of courtesy and official respect? Is it nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
that the Senator should call the traitor “His Excellency,”
and should hail him “President of the Confederation
of States”? And is it nothing that the Senator
should offer to the traitor thus addressed what of all
things he most coveted, to be turned against the Constitution
which the Senator has sworn to support?</p>

</div>

<p>Sir, the case is too plain for argument. You cannot
argue that two and two make four, that a straight line
is the shortest distance between two points, or that
the sun shines in the sky. All these are palpable to
reason or to sense. But, if I did not see before me
honored Senators, valued friends, who think otherwise,
I should say that to the patriot soul it is hardly less
palpable that a Senator, acknowledging in friendly correspondence
the chief of a Rebellion set on foot in defiance
of the United States, and sending to him arms,
whose only possible use was in upholding the Rebellion,
has justly forfeited that confidence which is as
much needed as a commission to assure his seat in
this Chamber. The case is very plain, and we have
taken too much time to consider it. We have been
dilatory when we ought to have been prompt, and have
hearkened to technical defences when we should have
surrendered to that indignation which disloyalty is calculated
to arouse.</p>

<p>The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>] has
reminded us&mdash;as John Quincy Adams reminded another
generation&mdash;of that beautiful work of Art in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
other wing of the Capitol, where the Muse of History,
with faithful pen, registers the transactions of each day,
and he trusted that over against the record of past disloyalty
another page might beam with the just judgment
that followed. But there is another work of Art, famous
as Art itself, and proceeding from its greatest master,
which may admonish us precisely what to do. The
ancient satrap Heliodorus, acting in the name of a distant
sovereign, entered that sumptuous temple dedicated
to the true God, where stood the golden candlesticks
and hung the veil which was yet unrent, and profanely
seized the riches under protection of the altar itself,
when suddenly, at the intercession of the high priest,
an angelic horseman armed with thongs is seen to
dash the intruder upon the marble pavement, and to
sweep him with scourges from the sacred presence.
Now that disloyalty, in the acknowledged name of a
distant traitor, intrudes into this sanctuary of the Constitution,
and insists upon a place at our altar, there
should be indignant chastisement, swift as the angelic
horseman that moves immortal in the colors of Raffaelle.
In vain do you interpose appeals for lenity or
forbearance. The case does not allow them. I know
well the beauty and the greatness of charity. For the
Senator I have charity; but there is a better charity
due to the Senate, whose solemn trusts are in jeopardy;
and even if you do not accept completely the
saying of Antiquity, which makes duty to country the
great charity embracing all other charities, you will not
deny that it is at least a commanding obligation, by
the side of which all that we owe the Senator is
small. And, Sir, let us not forget, let the precious
example be present in our souls, that He who taught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
the beauty and the greatness of charity was the first
to scourge the money-changers from the temple of the
Lord.</p>

<p>Mr. Davis, of Kentucky, followed. Some of his words are quoted,

<p>“The gentleman shakes his imperial locks like a Jove, and menaces death

commenced. For a time the ayes and noes bore a doubtful proportion.
Senator Willey, having held his vote in abeyance till the last, had just announced
that he should vote against the expulsion, and Senator Carlile, who
had been generally supposed to favor the resolution, also joined his colleague
among the noes. As the vote proceeded, the ayes became almost uninterrupted,
and we were prepared for the result. A few moments more and
the event was over,&mdash;felt by those who witnessed it to be scarcely less
solemn than the infliction of death itself, and which will probably be cited
in precedent when all its spectators shall have long been dust.”</p>

<h2><a name="ANSWER_OF_A_WITNESS_CRIMINATING_HIMSELF" id="ANSWER_OF_A_WITNESS_CRIMINATING_HIMSELF"></a>ANSWER OF A WITNESS CRIMINATING HIMSELF.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, on the Bill relating to Witnesses
before Committees, January 22, 1862.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>In considering the bill amending the provisions of the second section
of the Act of January 24, 1857, enforcing the attendance of witnesses
before Committees of either House of Congress, the following clause was
objected to: “And no witness shall hereafter be allowed to refuse to
testify to any fact or to produce any paper touching which he shall
be examined by either House of Congress or any Committee of either
House, for the reason that his testimony touching such fact or the production
of such paper <em>may tend to disgrace him or otherwise render
him infamous</em>.” In the debate that ensued Mr. Sumner spoke as
follows.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;There seems to be much inquiry
as to the Common Law on this question,
and various points are presented.</p>

<p>It is asked, for instance, whether a witness is obliged
to answer, where his answer will render him infamous.
I know the differences on this point, but cannot doubt
that by the Common Law the witness is obliged to
answer in such a case,&mdash;most certainly, if the question
is relevant and material.</p>

<p>Again, it is asked if a witness is permitted to determine
for himself whether to answer the question
proposed. Here also the Common Law, when properly
interpreted, is clear. The witness cannot be the
final judge. He must submit to the decision of the
Court, which will determine whether his answer may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
criminate him, by revealing either guilt or a possible
link in the evidence of guilt.</p>

<p>But then, Mr. President, why speak of the Common
Law? Why revert to these antiquarian inquiries, when
we have the Constitution of the United States specifically
dealing with this very question? In the fifth article
of the Amendments it is provided that “no person
shall be compelled <em>in any criminal case</em> to be a
witness against himself.” Such are the very words of
the Constitution, derived from the Common Law, but
imparting precision and limitation to the Common Law.
Now it seems to me it will be enough, if, on this occasion,
we follow the text of the Constitution. As in
the pending proposition there is nothing inconsistent
with the Constitution, we need not ransack the wide
and ancient demesnes of the Common Law to stir up
difficulties. Whatever the rule at Common Law, plainly
under the Constitution its operation is restricted to a
“criminal case,” leaving a case of infamy untouched.</p>

<p>I am free to say, Sir,&mdash;and what I am about to
remark is particularly in answer to the Senator from
New York [Mr. <span class="smcap">Harris</span>],&mdash;that, if this question were
presented independent of the Constitution, I should be
little disposed to follow the Common Law. In my
judgment the Common Law is less wise here than it
ought to be. I cannot but think that the jurisprudence
of other civilized countries, derived from the Roman
Law, supplies a better rule. There is no other civilized
jurisprudence under which a witness is excused from
answering any question, though the answer may affect
his character or honor, or even render him criminal.
The Common Law, at an early day, under a generous
inspiration, adopted a contrary principle, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> crossing
the ocean with our forefathers, is embodied in the text
of the Constitution. Finding it there, I accept it; certainly
I do not quarrel with it; but I cannot consent
that it shall receive any expansion, especially interfering
with the public interests. I hope the bill may
pass as it comes from the House, without amendment.
It is a good bill.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Harris, of New York, moved as an amendment: “Nor shall this
Act be so construed as to require any witness to testify to any fact
which shall tend to criminate him.” The question, being taken by
yeas and nays, resulted, yeas 19, nays 21; so the amendment failed.</p>

<p>The bill was then passed, and, January 24th, approved by the President.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, on a Five Minutes’ Rule,
January 27 and 29, 1862.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>A Joint Rule, moved by Mr. Wade, of Ohio, to facilitate secret
sessions, contained a restriction on debate, which was afterwards struck
out on his own motion. Mr. Sumner united with others against this
restriction, and some of his remarks are preserved here as a record of
opinion.</p>

<p>January 27th, he said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I am glad the Senator has modified his rule, so far
as it bears on the length of speeches. He thinks
a speech of five minutes long enough. If all had the
happy faculty of my distinguished friend, who so easily
speaks to the point, I doubt not it would be long enough;
but we must take Senators as they are, according to our
experience, and allow for their ways. Besides, such a
rule would be a departure from the constant policy of
the Senate.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The Joint Rule was much discussed, and underwent various modifications,
some on motion of Mr. Sumner. January 29th, a substitute
was moved by Mr. Sherman, of Ohio, and subsequently adopted, which
contained the restriction on debate abandoned by his colleague, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If decided in the affirmative, debate shall be confined to the subject-matter,
and be limited to five minutes by any member. <i>Provided</i>, That any
member shall be allowed five minutes to explain or oppose any pertinent
amendment.”</p>

</div>

<p>This led Mr. Sumner to speak again.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>I must confess that I hesitate to place among Rules
of the Senate a limitation of debate to five minutes,&mdash;not
that I desire in our conversations on business to
exceed that allowance. Personally I am content with
what pleases my associates; but I doubt the expediency
of such a rule, which thus far is a stranger among us.</p>

<p>Limitations of debate in various forms play a large
part in the other Chamber. Shall they begin here, even
in the small way proposed? A five minutes’ rule is not
the previous question, with its death-dealing <i>garrote</i>,
but it is a limitation of debate, and the Senate has from
the beginning set itself against any such restriction,
insisting always upon the largest latitude and amplest
opportunity.</p>

<p>If there were any obvious good to be accomplished
by such a rule, if there were any exigency seeming to
require the sacrifice, I should welcome it; but I put it
to Senators, whether experience in Executive Session
does not show that it is unnecessary. I cannot doubt
that the very business contemplated by the rule would
be discussed directly, plainly, briefly, according to the
essential nature of the question, even without any restriction.
But, if unnecessary, why make a change
which will look so ill that it were better to bear
inconvenience rather than have such a deformity?</p>

<p>It is enough, if on a critical occasion we are able to
close our doors, leaving the great privilege of debate
unchecked, to be employed as sword or buckler, according
to the promptings of patriotism and the conscience
of Senators.</p>

<h2><a name="INDUSTRIAL_EXHIBITION_AT_LONDON" id="INDUSTRIAL_EXHIBITION_AT_LONDON"></a>INDUSTRIAL EXHIBITION AT LONDON.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, on the Joint Resolution providing for
Representation there, January 31, 1862.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>January 31st, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint resolution
reported by Mr. Sumner from the Committee on Foreign Relations,
providing for representation at the Exhibition of the Industry of all
Nations at London in the year 1862.</p>

<p>Mr. Hale, of New Hampshire, said that he was “entirely opposed to
this whole thing.” Mr. Sumner then spoke as follows.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;The Senator from New Hampshire
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Hale</span>] objects to the joint resolution,
but he assigns no reason. When I make a personal appeal
to him, he declines to answer. Of course, that is
according to his right. He may be silent, though we
are always too happy when he speaks. It becomes my
duty, therefore, to explain the resolution, which I shall
do in few words.</p>

<p>At the extra session of Congress in July last, a joint
resolution was adopted in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the President be, and he hereby is, authorized to
take such measures as shall to him seem best to facilitate a
proper representation of the industrial interests of the United
States at the Exhibition of the Industry of all Nations to be
holden at London in the year 1862, and the sum of two
thousand dollars is hereby appropriated for the incidental
expenses thereof.”</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>
<p>The resolution passed Congress, and was approved by
the President on the 27th of July. Under it a Commission
was organized by the President, with the Secretary
of State as Chairman. Associated with him were
eminent gentlemen from different walks of life, from
different parts of the country&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Grimes.</span> What parts?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> All parts,&mdash;the West, the North, and
the East.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Grimes.</span> Who from the West?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> You will find the names on the printed
list. At a meeting in Washington, a sub-committee was
organized for the direction of business. Through this
sub-committee a correspondence has been conducted
with persons all over the country interested in the Exhibition,
and industrial products have been gathered at
New York, to be forwarded to London; but their proceedings
are stopped for want of means, and the actual
question is simply this: Will the Senate allow the business
already commenced under their auspices to fail, or
will they make the needful appropriation to carry it
forward?</p>

<p>There is at least one precedent. Ten years ago witnessed
an industrial exhibition in London, which attracted
the attention of the civilized world. There was
no provision in advance by the Government of the
United States for any representation there; but patriotic
citizens came forward at the last moment, volunteered
money and representation, and through their activity
we became honorably known there,&mdash;so, indeed,
I think I may say, as to gain renown for our industrial
products. I would not exaggerate; but nobody can forget
the triumph of the American reaper or the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
mower. I believe I state what cannot be denied, when
I say, that, through the representation of American industry
at that exhibition, we gained not only fame
abroad, but new fields of activity for our industry, and
new markets for our homely, but most useful products.</p>

<p>Now there is to be another exhibition, and the question
is, whether our country shall be represented. An
appropriation is needed for this purpose. The Committee,
after most careful deliberation, not acting, I assure
you, hastily, came to the conclusion that our country
should be represented there, and they recommended the
appropriation of the modest sum of $35,000. Persons
interested in the subject desired a larger appropriation.
The Committee concluded in favor of $35,000, as the
utmost they would ask from Congress at the present
time. Accordingly they have made that recommendation,
believing it for the general welfare.</p>

<p>I do not know the objection of my friend from New
Hampshire. Perhaps he is against any representation.
If so, I can understand that he should oppose the appropriation.
But is his objection founded on grounds
of economy peculiar to the present moment, or is it because
he is against such appearance at any time? If
founded on grounds of economy peculiar to the present
moment, I must say I cannot enter into his idea. Nobody
more completely than myself can appreciate the
importance of bending every corporal and intellectual
agent to the work of putting down the Rebellion; but
I am unwilling that meanwhile all the glorious and
beneficent arts of peace should slumber. Nor would I,
even while pushing this war to victory, cease to watch
with guardian care the industrial interests of my country.
Those interests, I am sure, will be advanced, if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
allow them to be represented at this great centre of
industry; and so will all the national resources increase
and multiply. And this is not simply because the exhibition
is in London, or because it may open a market
in London, but because through London we approach
all the great markets of the world; and while making
our products known in the great metropolis, we make
them known wherever civilization extends. The exhibition
will be an immense fair, to which exhibitors can
have access only through their respective governments.
I am unwilling to deprive American citizens of this opportunity.</p>

<p>I assume, therefore, that my friend cannot be against
contributing to this exhibition simply on grounds peculiar
to this moment. It must be on some other broader,
more general ground. I must say that I cannot enter
into that idea, either. If it was good for us to be represented
ten years ago,&mdash;and I believe all, after the exhibition,
were satisfied that it was good for us,&mdash;I believe
it better now. Surely, all this my friend has at heart.
I hope he will not forget that the interests of farmers,
the interests of inventors, the interests of mechanics,
the interests of all who toil and of all who produce,&mdash;in
one word, the great diversified interests of the people,
cannot fail to be promoted by this opportunity.
And here is reason enough for the small outlay.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>In the brief debate that ensued, Mr. Lane, of Indiana, said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The sword and the cannon are the reapers now, and the Rebels are the
harvest; and to that purpose and to those reapers I shall devote my attention.”</p>

</div>

<p>The joint resolution was lost,&mdash;yeas 17, nays 22; so that at the
London Exhibition the United States had no representation.</p>

ITSELF.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, February 6, 1862.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The Senate had under discussion an Army Bill, when Mr. Doolittle,
of Wisconsin, moved an amendment reducing and regulating
the mileage of Members of Congress. The remarks of Mr. Sumner
were not addressed to the merits of the question, but to the impropriety
of dealing with it in the pending bill.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;It seems clear that the discussion
in which we are launched is a departure
from the question before the Senate. The pending
bill is “to define the pay and emoluments of certain
officers of the army, and for other purposes,” and an
amendment is moved to reduce and regulate Congressional
mileage. By what process of association the two
are brought together it is not easy to see. Certainly nobody
looking for light on Congressional mileage would
think of exploring our army legislation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>My experience teaches me the advantage, not to say
the beauty of order, in the business of legislation, as in
all other business. There is a proper place for everything,
and everything should be in its proper place.
Especially should things plainly incongruous be kept
apart, and without commixture. But what more unreasonable
than the commixture proposed? Each measure
may be good in itself, but the two do not <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>go together.
They are without natural or logical connection.
One is not the incident of the other, nor in any respect
germane to the other. They should be in separate bills,
and be discussed separately.</p>

<p>Here we are in high debate on the Army Bill, and
all at once the subject is changed, although the original
bill is still before the Senate. But Congressional
mileage is enough by itself. Already it has occupied
the attention of the country, has been discussed in the
newspapers, and especially in the other House. It is
a Serbonian bog, not indeed “where armies whole have
sunk,” but only Members of Congress. Are you ready,
while considering another question, to revive this debate,
making it the accident of another, with which it
has nothing to do? Is it advisable? Is it according
to the natural order of business?</p>

AND RECONSTRUCTION.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Resolutions in the Senate, February 11, 1862. With Appendix.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sumner sent to the Chair a series of resolutions, which he described
by their title. They were then read, as follows.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">Resolutions declaratory of the Relations between the United
States and the Territory once occupied by certain States,
and now usurped by pretended Governments without Constitutional
or Legal Right.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Whereas certain States, rightfully belonging to
the Union of the United States, have, through
their respective Governments, wickedly undertaken to
abjure all those duties by which their connection with
the Union was maintained, to renounce all allegiance
to the Constitution, to levy war upon the National
Government, and, for the consummation of this treason,
have unconstitutionally and unlawfully confederated together
with the declared purpose of putting an end, by
force, to the supremacy of the Constitution within their
respective limits;</p>

<p>And whereas this condition of insurrection, organized
by pretended Governments, openly exists in North Carolina,
South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi,
Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Virginia,&mdash;except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
in Eastern Tennessee and Western Virginia,&mdash;and
the President of the United States, in a
proclamation duly made in conformity with an Act of
Congress, has declared the same to exist throughout
this territory, with the exceptions already named;</p>

<p>And whereas the extensive territory thus usurped
by these pretended Governments and organized into a
hostile confederation <em>belongs to the United States, as an
inseparable part thereof, under the sanctions of the Constitution</em>,
to be held in trust for the inhabitants in the
present and future generations, and is so completely
interlinked with the Union that it is forever dependent
thereupon;</p>

<p>And whereas the Constitution, which is the supreme
law of the land, cannot be displaced within this territory,
but must ever continue the supreme law thereof, notwithstanding
the doings of any pretended Governments,
acting singly or in confederation, hostile to its supremacy:
Therefore,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. <i>Resolved</i>, That any vote of secession, or other act,
by a State hostile to the supremacy of the Constitution
within its territory, <em>is inoperative and void against the
Constitution</em>, and, when sustained by <em>force</em>, becomes a
practical abdication by the State of all rights under the
Constitution, while the treason it involves works instant
forfeiture of all functions and powers essential to the
continued existence of the State as a body politic; so
that from such time forward the territory falls under the
exclusive jurisdiction of Congress, as other territory, and
the State becomes, according to the language of the law,
<i>felo de se</i>.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>

<p>2. That any combination of men assuming to act in
the place of such State, and attempting to ensnare or
coerce its inhabitants into a confederation hostile to
the Union, is rebellious, treasonable, and destitute of all
moral authority; and such combination is a usurpation
incapable of constitutional existence and utterly lawless,
<em>so that everything dependent upon it is without constitutional
or legal support</em>.</p>

<p>3. That the termination of a State under the Constitution
necessarily causes the termination of those
peculiar local institutions which, having no origin in
the Constitution, or in natural right independent of the
Constitution, are upheld by the sole and exclusive authority
of the State.</p>

<p>4. That Slavery, being a peculiar local institution,
derived from local law, <em>without any origin in the Constitution
or in natural right</em>, is upheld by the sole and exclusive
authority of the State, and must therefore cease,
legally and constitutionally, when the State on which it
depends has lapsed; for the incident must follow the
principal.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>5. That, in the exercise of exclusive jurisdiction over
the territory once occupied by the States, it is the duty
of Congress to see that the supremacy of the Constitution
is maintained in its essential principles, so that
everywhere in this extensive territory Slavery shall
cease to exist in fact, as it has already ceased to exist
in law or Constitution.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>

<p>6. That any recognition of Slavery in such territory,
or surrender of slaves under pretended laws of such
States, by an officer of the United States, civil or military,
is a practical recognition of the pretended Governments,
to the exclusion of the jurisdiction of Congress
under the Constitution, and is in the nature of aid and
comfort to the Rebellion that has been organized.</p>

<p>7. That any such recognition of Slavery, or surrender
of pretended slaves, besides being a practical recognition
of the pretended Governments, giving them aid and
comfort, is a denial of the rights of persons who by the
action of the States have become free, so that, under
the Constitution, they cannot again be enslaved.</p>

<p>8. That allegiance from the inhabitant and protection
from the Government are corresponding obligations, dependent
upon each other; so that, while the allegiance
of every inhabitant of this territory, without distinction
of class or color, is due to the United States, and cannot
in any way be defeated by the action of any pretended
Government, or by any pretence of property or claim to
service, the corresponding obligation of protection is at
the same time due from the United States to every such
inhabitant, without distinction of class or color; and it
follows that inhabitants held as slaves, whose paramount
allegiance is to the United States, may justly look to the
National Government for protection.</p>

<p>9. That the duty cast upon Congress by the action
of the States is enforced by the positive requirement
of the Constitution, that “no State shall enter into any
confederation,” or, “without the consent of Congress,
keep troops or ship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>s of war in time of peace,” or “enter
into any agreement or compact with another State,” or
“grant letters of marque and reprisal,” or “coin money,”
or “emit bills of credit,” or, “without the consent of the
Congress, lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports,”
all of which have been done by these pretended
Governments, and also by the positive injunction of the
Constitution, addressed to the Nation, that “the United
States shall guaranty to every State in this Union a republican
form of government”; and that, in pursuance
of this duty cast upon Congress, and further enjoined
by the Constitution, <em>Congress will assume complete jurisdiction
of such vacated territory, where such unconstitutional
and illegal things have been attempted, and will
proceed to establish therein republican forms of government
under the Constitution</em>, and, in the execution of
this trust, will provide carefully for the protection of
all the inhabitants thereof, for the security of families,
the organization of labor, the encouragement of industry,
and the welfare of society, and will in every way
discharge the duties of a just, merciful, and paternal
Government.</p>

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>When the reading was completed, Mr. Sumner asked that the resolutions
be printed and laid upon the table, adding that at some future
day he hoped to call them up for consideration. Then ensued a scene
not inaptly called a “flurry,” with regard to the disposition of the resolutions,&mdash;some
wishing their reference to a committee, where they
would be out of the way, and others wishing them laid on the table, so
as to avoid present debate. Mr. Sumner made the latter motion, so as
to keep them on the calendar of the Senate.</p>

<p>Mr. Davis, of Kentucky, moved at once their reference to the Committee
on the Judiciary. But the motion to lay on the table had precedence.
Mr. Sherman, of Ohio, said: “I do not think we ought to
take time now in discussing this question.” Mr. Anthony, of Rhode
Island, said: “If the motion to lay on the table be lost, the motion to
refer will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> debatable. I vote ‘yea.’” The motion of Mr. Sumner
prevailed,&mdash;yeas 21, nays 15.</p>

<p>Chief among the nays were the Democrats and the ordinary revilers
of Antislavery movements; but the division did not indicate definite
opinions on the resolutions. It was in no sense an adverse vote, although
often cited as such by hostile partisans, which was the more
curious as Mr. Sumner voted with the majority.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>February 13th, Mr. Davis introduced a series of counter resolutions,
eight in number, which were ordered to lie on the table and be
printed. Their special object was the protection of loyal persons, so
that no form of confiscation or forfeiture should reach them,&mdash;meaning,
of course, protection against Emancipation,&mdash;“whilst inflicting
on the guilty leaders condign and exemplary punishment, granting
amnesty and oblivion to the comparatively innocent masses.”</p>

<p>The difference developed here entered into subsequent debates. Mr.
Sumner regarded Slavery as the great offender, besides being a constant
wrong, and he wished it destroyed completely. Others sought to confine
the sphere of Emancipation to the slaves of Rebels.</p>

<p>After certain Senatorial protests at a subsequent day, the question of
Congressional power, presented by the resolutions, and involving Reconstruction,
dropped out of sight, partly because the Proclamation of
Emancipation provided a method against Slavery, and partly because
Rebel resistance and the cloud which soon afterwards lowered upon our
arms prevented Reconstruction from becoming what was called “a practical
question,” except to those who, anticipating the future, saw how
much would be gained by a sure rule capable of immediate application
as the national power prevailed.</p>

<p>A speech on this subject, especially vindicating the positions he had
taken, was prepared by Mr. Sumner during this session; but the proper
occasion for its delivery not occurring, it was handed over to the <i>Atlantic
Monthly</i>, where it appeared as an article, October, 1863. Some of the
points of the resolutions reappeared in the speech of the 19th May, on
“Rights of Sovereignty and Rights of War”;<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> also in the resolutions
of June 2 and 6, 1862, relating to the Provisional Government of North
Carolina.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<h3>APPENDIX.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>These Resolutions became the occasion of controversy, and occupied
public attention. They have been considered the starting-point of Reconstruction,
although the primary object on their introduction was
to strike at Slavery. The principle here enunciated, that Slavery,
being without support in the Constitution or in natural right, fell with
the local governments on which it depended, seemed to Mr. Sumner
impregnable, and he never ceased to regret that it was not authoritatively
announced at an early day, believing that such a juridical truth
adopted by the Government would have smoothed the way, while it
hastened the great result. The essential difficulty proceeded from the
indisposition to Emancipation; for here was only another form of the
perpetual question, “Shall the slaves be set free?”</p>

<p>Towards the close of the war, Mr. Everett, in an eloquent speech at
Faneuil Hall, gave his valuable authority in favor of this principle.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I will add, that it is very doubtful whether any act of the Government
of the United States was necessary to liberate the slaves in a State which is
in rebellion. There is much reason for the opinion, that, by the simple act
of levying war against the United States, the relation of Slavery was terminated,
certainly so far as concerns the duty of the United States to recognize
it or to refrain from interfering with it. Not being founded on the Law
of Nature, and resting solely on positive local law, and that not of the United
States, as soon as it becomes either the motive or pretext of an unjust war
against the Union, an efficient instrument in the hands of the Rebels for carrying
on the war, a source of military strength to the Rebellion and of danger
to the Government at home and abroad, with the additional certainty,
that, in any event but its abandonment, it will continue in all future time
to work these mischiefs, who can suppose it is the duty of the United States
to continue to recognize it? To maintain this would be a contradiction in
terms.… No such absurdity can be admitted; and any citizen of the
United States, from the President down, who should by any overt act recognize
the duty of a slave to obey a Rebel master in a hostile operation,
would himself be giving aid and comfort to the enemy.”<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Brownson’s judgment was the same way, as appears in a citation
on a subsequent page.</p>

<p>Besides the enunciation of this juridical truth, which, frankly adopted,
must have put an end to Slavery legally and constitutionally in the
Rebel States, the Resolutions further asserted the jurisdiction of Congress
over these States, and the duty to establish republican government
therein,&mdash;in other words, the plenary power and duty of Reconstruction.
Although these were formally denied, yet the power was
practically recognized and the duty was followed, but only after injurious
delay and the conflict of debate.</p>

<p>The Resolutions were especially criticized, in the Senate and out of
it, for what was termed the doctrine of “State Suicide,” and “the
lapse of States into Territories.” They were described as proposing
to reduce States into Territories. Naturally, the sentiment of State
Rights was aroused.</p>

<h4>SENATORS ADVERSE.</h4>

<p>Mr. Willey, of Virginia, saw in them a scheme of “unconditional,
immediate, and universal Emancipation”; and he added:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“These consequences, in my judgment, involve the lives of thousands
of my fellow-citizens, and the happiness of all the loyal people of all the
border slaveholding States.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then referring to the people of the South, he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Especially will they point to the sweeping resolutions of the great apostle
of Abolition, the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. <span class="smcap">Sumner</span>], which by
one dash of the pen deprive every Southern man of his slaves.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then came the familiar parallel between Mr. Sumner and Jefferson Davis.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Sir, a few weeks ago we expelled a Senator, because, on the 1st of
March last, he wrote a letter to Jefferson Davis, commending to his regard
a friend who had a valuable fire-arm to sell, and who visited the South mainly
for the purpose of selling it. This was deemed evidence of disloyalty
sufficient to warrant his ejection from the Senate. But what do we now
see? What, for instance, is the proposition of the distinguished Senator
from Massachusetts [Mr. <span class="smcap">Sumner</span>]? It is, by one fell swoop of his pen, to
blot ten or twelve States out of the Union forever to remit them back to a
Territorial condition, and thus to involve our muniments of right, the titles
to our estates, our franchises and municipal privileges, in a kind of hotch-pot,
begetting and superinducing an inevitable confusion as inexplicable
and dark as original Chaos.”<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Fessenden, in reply to Mr. Willey, emphatically disowned Mr.
Sumner.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Why, Sir, I do not hesitate to say here most distinctly, for myself, that I
dissent entirely from the conclusions of the honorable Senator from Massachusetts,
as stated in his resolutions. I do not look upon the States of this
Union as gone and destroyed.… It is enough to say, in this connection,
that upon this particular point the opinions of the honorable Senator from
Massachusetts are his own, for which he alone is responsible, and which he
is undoubtedly well able to defend.”<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

</div>

<p>On the next day Mr. Sherman followed in the same vein,&mdash;vindicating
the Republican party, and especially disowning Mr. Sumner, which
in the course of his speech he did twice. The first time he said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. <span class="smcap">Sumner</span>], as he has a perfect
right to do, introduced a series of resolutions giving his idea about the effect
of the war upon the political status of the States, and at once those resolutions
are seized upon as the dogmas of the Republican party, and we are
denounced for them, although candid men must know that they are but the
emanation of a single individual, who has decided convictions on this subject,
and who is far in advance of any political organization in this country.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then, at the close of his speech, after saying that “we ought to oppose
all useless and unconstitutional measures of legislation,” he proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I, therefore, cannot help but say, that, while I respect the motives of
the honorable Senator from Massachusetts, while I give him credit for consistency,
ability, and a great deal of culture, and am always glad to hear
him speak, yet I must confess, that, when I looked over his resolutions, they
struck me with surprise and regret. They would revolutionize this Government.
Sir, strike the States out of this system of Government, and your
Government is lost and gone. I cannot conceive of the United States governing
colonies and provinces containing millions upon millions of people,
black and white. I do not think such a thing can exist. I do not believe
it is in the power of Secession to bring us to such a state of things. I can
draw no distinction between the resolutions of the Senator from Massachusetts
and the doctrines that are proclaimed by Jefferson Davis.… The
doctrine of the Senator from Massachusetts is substantially an acknowledgment
of the right of secession, of the right to secede. He, however, puts
the States in the condition of abject Territories, to be governed by Congress.
Jefferson Davis puts it in the power of the people of the States to govern
the States themselves. As to which is the most dangerous or obnoxious
doctrine I leave every man to determine.”<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Not long afterwards, Mr. Dixon, of Connecticut, took up the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>strain, characterizing the doctrine of the Resolutions as “fatal to our
form of government, destructive of our Federal system, and utterly
incompatible with a restoration of harmonious relations between the
States in which rebellion now prevails and the United States”; and
he condensed his judgment by calling the doctrine a “fatal heresy.”<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Cowan, of Pennsylvania, some time later, spoke in harmony with
the others.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Now everybody knows that the honorable Senator from Massachusetts
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Sumner</span>] has a scheme by which he proposes to turn all these States,
in case they could be conquered, into Territories, that they shall be governed
by the United States as Territories, and then, when their people come to
their senses,&mdash;this is the language of the advocates of the scheme,&mdash;they
are to be readmitted into the Union upon terms. Mr. President, I do not
know anybody hardly who has not deprecated that as a most mischievous
scheme to agitate just at present.”<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Still later, Mr. Doolittle, of Wisconsin, in an elaborate speech, discussed
Mr. Sumner’s policy in the same spirit, saying that he had provided
a way of disunion,&mdash;“which for brevity I will call, with no disrespect
to my honorable friend from Massachusetts, <span class="smcap">the Sumner way
for States to go out of the Union</span>, namely, by Act of Congress.”
And he attributed the same position to his colleague, Mr. Howe.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“What, in effect, do the Senator from Massachusetts and my colleague
propose? To place outside of the Constitution, and to govern with unlimited
power, eleven States and ten million people, nearly one third of all the States
and people of the United States, without any representation.”<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Howe replied to Mr. Doolittle, and, after referring to a resolution
introduced by himself, declaring that “local governments ought
to be provisionally organized forthwith for the people in each of the
districts named in the preamble hereto,”<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> being the Rebel States, paid
the following tribute to Mr. Sumner.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As to the matter of fact, whether this resolution is the Lincoln and Johnson
theory or the Sumner theory, the Senator from Massachusetts has not
yet, I regret to say, indorsed that resolution, nor anything that I said in
support of it; and I suppose the Senator from Massachusetts will claim the
right, which, under the Constitution, as I understand it, belongs to every
Senator on this floor, to speak for himself. If it should hereafter happen to
receive his indorsement, it will be very gratifying to me. If I should find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>that I had given utterance on this floor to one sentiment which is approved
by the Senator from Massachusetts, it will be only a small compensation for
the great number of living sentiments to which I have listened from the Senator
from Massachusetts, and which are bound to live long after my colleague
and myself shall have passed from this stage of existence.”<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Sumner, acting upon the principles of his Resolutions,
insisted upon colored suffrage in the Rebel States to be ordained
by Congress, as will appear hereafter in these volumes. Senators who
had originally opposed the power of Congress over these States now
united in this requirement. Among those who still stood out was Mr.
Doolittle, who, after alluding to President Lincoln’s policy of Reconstruction,
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Neither Mr. Lincoln, nor any member of his Cabinet, nor more than two
Senators, I believe, in this body, the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. <span class="smcap">Sumner</span>]
and the Senator from Missouri [Mr. <span class="smcap">Gratz Brown</span>], at that time
advocated Reconstruction upon a basis including negro suffrage.”</p>

</div>

<p>And Mr. Doolittle then proclaimed that more than twenty Republican
Senators, who had stood with him, “advocating Reconstruction
upon the white basis,” now “go over to the side of the Senator from
Massachusetts, and advocate his theory of Reconstruction upon the
basis of negro suffrage and white disfranchisement.”<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>Then came another speech by the same Senator, in which he describes
Mr. Sumner as adding to his demands only to find them
adopted by Senators who had begun by opposing him.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“My friend from Massachusetts ought to feel a sense of profound satisfaction
to see the progress they have made. I mean no discourtesy, when I
say the ideas advanced by him that night, rejected then by a majority of
four to one, rule the Senate now. Not only have they educated, they have
Sumnerized the Senate.”<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Hendricks, of Indiana, the Democratic leader of the Senate, differing
widely from Mr. Sumner, in the debate on the Supplementary
Reconstruction Bill, gave this testimony:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I said in the Senate, a year or two ago, that the course of things is this:
the Senator from Massachusetts steps out boldly, declares his doctrine, and
then he is approached, and finally he governs. Believing that he is in the
right,&mdash;I concede that belief to him as a Senator,&mdash;his place in this body
and before this country to-day is a very proud one. He was told somewhat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>sneeringly, two years ago, that among his party friends he stood alone; and
to-day they all stand upon his position. This is a compliment and indorsement
of sagacity and intelligence that but few men receive in the course of
a public life.”<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

</div>


<h4>THE PRESS.</h4>

<p>From the Senate the question was transferred to the great arena
where pamphlets, reviews, and newspapers were the disputants. Here
the opposition in the Senate found frequent expression. The Resolutions
by their positive character offered a full front, and they were
openly attacked.</p>

<p>Public meetings and committees also made them the subject of discussion,&mdash;especially
a great meeting at Cooper Institute, New York,
and a meeting of the German Republican Committee in New York,
where they were fully sustained.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>The <i>North American Review</i>,<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> in an elaborate article, under the
title of “Constitutional Law,” afterwards published in a pamphlet with
the author’s name<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> on the title-page, treated the Resolutions with a
severity which may be judged by the concluding words.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is to be hoped that disloyalty will not become more general by reason
of threats of conquest, or by propositions that the United States shall
become <i>administrator de bonis non</i> of the seceding States. One description
of treason against the United States consists ‘in adhering to their enemies,
giving them aid and comfort.’ Mr. Conway<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> and Mr. Sumner have given
the ‘aid and comfort.’ Had they sent in their <em>adhesion</em> at the same time,
they would have done the Union much less mischief.”</p>

</div>

<p>Not content with this article, the learned author addressed the following
letter to the <i>Boston Journal</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Unconstitutional Legislation.</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Will you permit me to say, that, the sooner the Republican
party cuts itself loose from all unconstitutional projects (whether they relate
to emancipation by proclamation, conquering States and holding them as Territories,
confiscation without trial, or any other measure not warranted by
the Constitution), the sooner it will begin to provide for its own salvation.</p>

<p>On the other side, Dr. Brownson, the able and indefatigable Catholic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>writer, sustained Mr. Summer in a powerful article, entitled “State
Rebellion, State Suicide.”<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> A few sentences will show its character.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The slave-owners, by their rebellion, have unquestionably forfeited their
right under the Federal Constitution to be protected in their slave property,
or, as to that matter, in any other species of property. If Slavery be ever
again recognized as legal, therefore, the responsibility will attach not to
Slave States only, but to the whole people of the United States, and we
of the Free States will become, clearly and decidedly, <i>participes criminis</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>“We hold with Mr. Sumner in his noble Resolutions, creditable alike to
him as a statesman and a lawyer, that the State by rebellion commits suicide,
and lapses as a civil and political entity. All laws, customs, or usages,
depending for their vitality, force, or vigor on the State, are rendered null
and void by its secession, and are to be treated as <i>non avenues</i>. Slavery
exists in any country only by municipal law,&mdash;in no country by the <i>jus
gentium</i>. In our political system it exists by the local law, or by the law
or usage of a particular State, in distinction from a law or usage of the
United States.”<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>“The Rebellion, in a word, kills the whole State and everything dependent
on it. Whether the State be revived and permitted to return to the
Union depends entirely on the good pleasure of the Federal authority. It
cannot be claimed as a right by the population on the territory of the defunct
State. As they could not take the territory out of the Union, and as
they, so long as they remain on it, are within the jurisdiction of the United
States, the Federal Government has authority to govern them, and may
govern them either as a Territory or as a conquered province.”<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>“The two most important measures ever introduced into the American
Congress are, first, the resolutions of Mr. Sumner in the Senate, declaring
that a State by rebellion commits suicide, and, second, General Ashley’s
bill in the House, from the Territorial Committee, providing for the government
of the rebellious States as Territories.… Their adoption would
save constitutional government, and give new guaranties of man’s capacity
for freedom. But whether these measures be adopted or not, Mr. Sumner’s
resolutions will serve as a platform on which will take their stand all in the
country worthy of consideration for their political sagacity, their wise statesmanship,
their disinterestedness, and their nobility of sentiment.”<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>The newspapers were not behind the quarterlies in earnestness of difference;
but citations from them will not add to the case already stated.
An article in the <i>Temps</i>, an Imperialist organ at Paris, is interesting,

<p>“The confidence of the nation possesses the Washington Cabinet, too often
accessible to incertitude and discouragements, and its members seem about
to rally to the system presented by Mr. Sumner. It is known that the Constitution
gives to Congress the absolute power over what is called the Territories,&mdash;that
is to say, the territorial portions not yet incorporated politically
into the Union.… The practical consequence which Mr. Sumner draws
from that can be divined. He proposes to consider the Rebel States as simple
Territories, which necessarily after victory will return one after another
to their vitality. Then, according to the manner in which the Washington
Government and Congress shall pronounce definitively on this supreme question,
can admittance into the Union be refused to States which do not abolish
Slavery or regulate it in a sense favorable to Abolition.”<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<h4>CORRESPONDENCE.</h4>

<p>The response by letters showed that Senatorial protest and newspaper
criticism did not prevent the acceptance of the Resolutions by earnest,
thoughtful people, anxious for decisive measures and a true preparation
for the future. Here was a plan of Reconstruction without Slavery,
and this was a wide-spread longing of hearts.</p>

<p>Hon. John Jay, afterwards Minister at Vienna, wrote from New
York:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There is no question about the fact that Slavery in the Rebel States
has ceased to exist, within the meaning and under the protection of the Constitution.</p>

<p>“I have thought somewhat on the matter, and have just completed an
argument on it, which I proposed to include in my lecture before the Washington
Association. The Southern States have ceased to be States of the
Union; their soil has become national territory; and the slaves, in the eyes
of the Constitution, are freemen. I wish your resolutions had been referred
to some committee from whom we could have had a careful report in their
favor, even though it were a minority report, to get the argument before the
country.”</p>

</div>

<p>Charles T. Rodgers, President of the Young Men’s Republican Union,
wrote from New York:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have just read the preamble and resolutions offered by you in the
Senate, in which you define the position and status of the revolted States,
and of persons held to service under the laws thereof.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>

<p>“I cannot refrain from expressing to you, personally, my pleasure at the
fact that the true doctrine on this subject has been so clearly laid down. I
am sure that your theory is the true one, and, in fact, the only one this
Government can consistently follow, and the only one which seems to offer
a plain path out of the maze of conflicting legal and constitutional points in
which so many of our public men seem to have become entangled. The
States, by seceding, have committed suicide. The slaves therein are <i>de
facto</i> free. Stick to that, and you will come out all right.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Charles A. Dana, the accomplished journalist, afterwards Assistant
Secretary of War, wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I fully appreciate the difficulty of settling the South after it is conquered.
I don’t see how your plan can be avoided; <i>bon gré, mal gré</i>, it is what we
all must come to.”</p>

</div>

<p>Park Benjamin, writer and poet, who had not formerly sympathized
with Mr. Sumner politically, wrote from New York:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Your Territorial plan is the only right and just one, let the short-sighted
geese hiss at it as they may.”</p>

</div>

<p>William Herries, journalist, wrote from New York:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It was my pleasure to-night to be present at the meeting of the German
Republican Central Committee, and it was truly refreshing to witness the
enthusiasm manifested in behalf of those lofty sentiments embraced in your
Rebel Territory Bill. A Memorial is now in course of preparation for you
on the subject.”</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. J. Y. Smith, of the <i>Wisconsin Argus</i>, wrote from Madison:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Early in the Rebellion I took the same view of the effect of Secession
upon the Rebel States as is set forth in your Resolutions,&mdash;suggested it
to our Wisconsin Senators, and wrote several articles in support of it, but
could find very few public journals or public men to agree with me. When
your resolutions on that subject appeared, I hailed them with joy, and have
been exerting the little influence I have to instil the principle into the public
mind. It is the true theory, and I wonder why any friend of the country
can object to it. By their rebellion they have tumbled Slavery right into
our bag, and if we shake it out, our life will go for its life.”</p>

</div>

<p>Thomas Garrett, a Quaker Abolitionist, wrote from Wilmington,
Delaware:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“I yesterday read the resolutions thou offeredst on the 11th of this month,
and think the view thou hast taken is correct: that any vote of secession, or
other act by which a State may undertake to put an end to the supremacy
of the Constitution within its territory, is inoperative and void against the
Constitution, and, when sustained by force, is practical abdication by the
State of all rights under the Constitution; and every such State ought to
be expunged and revert back into a Territory, and begin anew. I thought,
six months since, that ere this Slavery would have been abolished by the
War Power in all the seceded States, but at present I have very little hope
of it. It seems to me incredible that the President and Cabinet should
have so much more sympathy for the Rebels than they have for the loyal
North.”</p>

</div>

<p>W. G. Snethen, lawyer, earnest against Slavery, wrote from Baltimore:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Your admirable resolutions respecting the status of the Rebel region, in
which the Rebellion has killed Slavery, did my heart good, especially as
indicating an Administration policy. I hope and pray that this doctrine
speaks the mind of Lincoln, and that he will not flinch from its execution
with the whole power of the Government.… Oh that Congress may adopt
your set just as they came from your mighty pen, and then follow them
up by legislation to give them active life!”</p>

</div>

<p>Edward P. Brownson communicated the opinion of his father, Orestes
A. Brownson, in a letter from Elizabeth, New Jersey.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I suppose my father has long since told you of his delight, when you introduced
your Resolutions into the Senate. The joy with which he read
them, and the attention he has given them, you will find very clearly expressed
in the deep and careful study he has given the subject, evident in
his article on <i>State Rebellion, State Suicide</i>; and he would much rather see
them pass than win a victory in the field.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Maria Weston Chapman, the devoted Abolitionist, and among
the earliest in the warfare, wrote from Boston:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Thanks a thousand-fold for the eleventh volume Pacific Railroad Survey.
Your Resolutions are <em>the great Pacific Road to Freedom</em>,&mdash;made possible by
the War Power though they be. I thank you a million-fold. To say so

that the highest numbers were needed fitly to express human gratitude for
services rendered to human nature.”</p>

<p>Jabez C. Woodman, an able lawyer, wrote from Portland, Maine:&mdash;</p>

prevail. He then said he was in favor of coercion,&mdash;that he would subjugate
the Rebel States, and, taking them at their word, he would not acknowledge
them at once as States, but would govern them as conquered provinces, till
they were fit to govern themselves.”</p>

<p>Elizur Wright, the early and constant Abolitionist, wrote from Boston:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Your Resolutions are <em>the very thing</em>. Had they been passed at the extra
session, the war would have been over before now. They, or something to
the same effect, must be passed before spring opens, or we are lost. Victories,
without this <em>law</em> of the <em>conquest</em>, cannot save us. Quite the reverse. I
beg you to press the resolutions with any amount of animosity or violence,
and to know that all that is alive at the North will sustain you.</p>

<p>Rev. George C. Beckwith, Secretary of the American Peace Society,
wrote from Boston:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I had some difficulty for a time about your <em>Territorial</em> views; but I am
coming fully to the conclusion that we must deal with all rebellion in some
such way, before the South can be brought to any terms. We must have
and keep them all in our grasp, until they prove themselves, by their good
behavior, fit to come again into the Union.”</p>

</div>

<p>Charles Husband, an intelligent citizen, whose correspondence was
always valuable, wrote from Taunton, Massachusetts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have to thank you for a copy of your Resolutions, and perhaps you will
not deem me intrusive, if I wish you a hearty God-speed in the work you
have undertaken,&mdash;a work the successful accomplishment of which is large
enough to fill the measure of the highest ambition,&mdash;a work which will redeem
the nation from its low estate, which asserts the nation’s sovereignty
and self-existence, instead of ‘borrowing leave to be,’&mdash;which demands for
the nation the paramount allegiance of every inhabitant of its territory, and
sweeps away every institution which interposes itself between the nation
and that allegiance,&mdash;which calls the Government from being the minister of
oppression and the mere dispenser of patronage, to take upon itself the high
purposes and duties for which ‘governments are instituted among men,’&mdash;which
transmutes four millions of chattels into men.</p>

<p>“Allow me to suggest (although it has not, probably, escaped your notice),
that the constitutional requirement, that every legislative, executive,
and judicial officer in the States shall be sworn to the support of the Constitution
of the United States, leaves the whole of the Rebel territory without a
civil officer whom the Government can recognize, as every such pretended
officer is just as much a usurper in the eye of the Constitution as Jefferson
Davis himself.”</p>

</div>

<p>Henry Hoyt, publisher and bookseller, wrote from Boston:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“I cannot sleep another night till I have thanked you from the bottom
of my heart for your bill resolving Rebeldom into Territorial relations
again. Of all measures ever introduced into Congress, nothing so completely
meets the case of the present exigency of our country’s history,
and <em>nothing but this</em> can make the confederacy of the whole land stand in
safety a single year. We may continue to win battles, but, so long as the
ruins of Slavery exist in the body politic, we shall stand on a volcano.”</p>

</div>

<p>But the most important commentary on the Resolutions is found in
the measures of Reconstruction subsequently adopted, all of which
stand on the power of Congress over the Rebel States, which they
positively assert, including especially the power and duty to guaranty
a republican form of government.</p>

<p>The Report of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, drawn up by
its Chairman, Mr. Fessenden, asserted that the Rebel States “having
voluntarily renounced the right to representation, and disqualified themselves
by crime from participating in the Government, the burden now
rests upon them, before claiming to be reinstated in their former condition,
to show that they are qualified to resume Federal relations.”
It then laid down the rule:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Having, by this treasonable withdrawal from Congress, and by flagrant
rebellion and war, forfeited all civil and political rights and privileges under
the Federal Constitution, they can only be restored thereto by the permission
and authority of that constitutional power against which they rebelled, and
by which they were subdued.”<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here was the power of Congress asserted,&mdash;but very tardily, and
after original denial.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A calm observer has recently recorded his regret that the Resolutions
were not adopted at once, and consistently acted upon. After saying
that “the mover was overwhelmed with a tornado of denunciation and
abuse,” and that the opposition “rendered any satisfactory reconstruction
as nearly impracticable as can well be imagined,” the writer proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Time has fully vindicated the wisdom of Mr. Sumner’s course, and
many of the Senators against the measure now admit their mistake,&mdash;while
every man who comes here from the South says that their present miserable
condition grows out of that great error.</p>

<p>“To the Democratic party the rejection of the Resolutions was a God-send.
It made the continued existence of the Democratic party possible.”<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<h2><a name="TREASURY_NOTES_A_LEGAL_TENDER" id="TREASURY_NOTES_A_LEGAL_TENDER"></a>TREASURY NOTES A LEGAL TENDER.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, on the Clause making Treasury Notes
A Legal Tender, February 13, 1862.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>February 13th, the Senate having under consideration a bill from
the House of Representatives to authorize the issue of United States
notes, and for the redemption or funding thereof, and for funding the
floating debt of the United States, Mr. Collamer, of Vermont, moved to
strike out the following words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And such notes herein authorized, and the notes authorized by the Act
of July 17, 1861, shall be receivable in payment of all public dues and demands
of every description, and of all claims and demands against the
United States of every kind whatsoever, except for interest upon bonds and
notes, which shall be paid in coin, <em>and shall also be lawful money and a legal
tender in payment of all debts, public and private, within the United States,
except interest as aforesaid</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Collamer stated that some desired him to try the sense of the
Senate on the question of private debts, but he preferred the above
amendment, “that these notes shall not be tenderable upon any debts
due by the Government or by individuals.” On this proposition he
had already made an elaborate speech.</p>

<p>Mr. Fessenden also spoke elaborately upon the whole bill; but he
characterized the legal tender clause as “the main question.” Here he
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The question, then, is, Does the necessity exist?… If the necessity
exists, I have no hesitation upon the subject, and shall have none. If there
is nothing left for us to do but that, and that will effect the object, I am perfectly
willing to do that.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Sumner spoke last in the debate, and at least one Senator acknowledged
that on the question of constitutional power he had been
changed by this speech. The vote was then taken on the amendment,
and resulted, yeas 17, nays 22.</p>

<p>So the motion to strike out the legal tender clause was rejected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Doolittle moved an amendment so as to make the notes “a legal
tender in payment of all public debts, and all private debts hereafter
contracted within the United States,” which was rejected without a
division.</p>

<p>Mr. King also moved a comprehensive amendment, which likewise
struck out the legal tender clause; but it was rejected without a division.</p>

<p>The bill was then passed, yeas 30, nays 7.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I am sorry to ask the attention
of the Senate at this late hour; but the importance
of the question must be my apology.</p>

<p>In what I say I shall confine myself exclusively to a
single feature of the present bill. Others may regret
that the exigencies of the country were not promptly
met by taxation,&mdash;or that at the beginning a different
system was not organized by the Treasury, through
which the national securities might have found a readier
market,&mdash;or that the national credit was not sustained,
at the period of bank suspension, by the resolute
redemption of the Government securities in coin at any
present sacrifice. But it is useless to discuss these questions.
The time for such discussion has passed. The
Tax Bill is not yet matured. The system adopted by
the Treasury cannot be changed at once, if it were desirable.
It is too late to organize the redemption of
the national securities in coin on the daily application
of holders. Meanwhile the exigencies of Government
have become imperative. Money must be had.</p>

<p>And we are told that the credit of Government can
be saved only by an act that seems like a forfeiture of
credit. Paper promises are to be made a legal tender,
like gold and silver; and this provision is to be ingrafted
on the present bill authorizing the issue of Treasury
notes to the amount of $150,000,000.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>
<p>All confess that they vote for this proposition with
reluctance, while to many it seems positively unconstitutional.
Of course, if unconstitutional, there is an end
of it, and all discussion of its character is superfluous.
I am compelled by candor to declare that the doubts
which perplex me do not proceed from the Constitution.
If the question of constitutionality were in all respects
novel, or, as lawyers phrase it, of first impression, then
I might join with friends in their doubts. But it seems
to me that the constitutional power of Congress to
make Treasury notes a legal tender was settled as long
ago as when it was settled that Congress might authorize
the issue of Treasury notes; for from time immemorial
the two have gone together, one as incident of
the other, and, unless expressly severed, they naturally
go together.</p>

<p>It is true that in the Constitution there are no words
expressly conferring upon Congress the power to make
Treasury notes a legal tender; but there are no words
expressly conferring upon Congress the power to issue
Treasury notes. If we consult the text, we find it as
silent with regard to one as with regard to the other.
There is no silence with regard to the States, which are
expressly prohibited to “emit bills of credit,” or “make
anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment
of debts.” Treasury notes are “bills of credit”; and
this prohibition is imperative on the States. The inference
is just, that this prohibition, expressly addressed
to the States, was not intended to embrace Congress indirectly,
as it obviously does not embrace it directly.
The presence of the prohibition, however, shows that
the subject was in the minds of the framers of the
Constitution. If they failed to extend it still further,
it is reasonable to conclude that they left the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
subject in all its bearings to the sound discretion of
Congress, under the ample powers intrusted to it.</p>

<p>The stress so constantly put upon the prohibitions
addressed to the States will justify me in introducing
the opinion of Mr. Justice Story, in his Commentaries.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is manifest that all these prohibitory clauses, as to
coining money, emitting bills of credit, and tendering anything
but gold and silver in payment of debts, are founded
upon the same general policy, and result from the same general
considerations. <em>The policy is, to provide a fixed and uniform
value throughout the United States</em>, by which commercial
and other dealings of the citizens, as well as the moneyed
transactions of the Government, might be regulated.”<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Plainly, no inference adverse to the powers of the
National Government can be drawn from these prohibitory
clauses; for, whatever may be these powers,
there will be a fixed and uniform value throughout
the United States.</p>

<p>As we proceed, the case becomes more clear. The
States are prohibited to issue “bills of credit”; but
there is no such prohibition on the National Government,
which may do in the premises what the States
cannot do. The failure to prohibit is equivalent to a
recognition of the power. In other words, the National
Government may issue “bills of credit,” which have
been characterized by no less a person than Chief-Justice
Marshall, in pronouncing the opinion of the
Supreme Court, when he said: “To ‘emit bills of credit’
conveys to the mind the idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> of issuing paper intended
to circulate through the community for its ordinary
purposes <em>as money</em>, which paper is redeemable at a
future day.” And then again the learned Chief Justice
said: “The term has acquired an appropriate meaning;
and ‘bills of credit’ signify <em>a paper medium</em>, intended
to circulate between individuals, and between
Government and individuals, for the ordinary purposes
of society.”<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> This “money” and “paper medium”
the States are prohibited from emitting; but there is
no such prohibition on the National Government,&mdash;as
there is not a single word to prohibit the National
Government from determining what shall be a legal
tender.</p>

<p>From the proceedings of the National Convention it
appears that a clause in the first draught of the Constitution
empowering Congress to “emit bills on the credit
of the United States” was after discussion struck out.
In the debate on this clause, Mr. Madison asked: “Will
it not be sufficient to prohibit the making them <em>a tender</em>?
This will remove the temptation to emit them with unjust
views.” Mr. Mason said, “Though he had a mortal
hatred to paper money, yet, as he could not foresee
all emergencies, he was unwilling to tie the hands of
the [National] Legislature. He observed, that the late
war could not have been carried on, had such a prohibition
existed.” Mr. Mercer was “opposed to a prohibition
of it altogether. It will stamp suspicion on
the Government to deny it a discretion on this point.”
Mr. Butler remarked, that “paper was a legal tender
in no country in Europe. He was urgent for disarming
the Government of such a power.” Mr. Mason was “still
averse to tying the hands of the Legislature <em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>altogether</em>.
If there was no example in Europe, as just remarked,
it might be observed, on the other side, that there was
none in which the Government was restrained on this
head.” Mr. Gorham was “for striking out, without
inserting any prohibition.” And this view finally prevailed.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
Thus it appears that the suggestion was made
to prohibit the making of bills a tender; but this suggestion
was not acted on, and no such prohibition was
ever moved. It is evident that the Convention was
not prepared for a measure so positive. Less still was
it prepared for a prohibition to emit bills. Such is
the record. While all words expressly authorizing bills
were struck out, nothing was introduced in restriction
of the powers of Congress on this subject.</p>

<p>Thus was the whole question practically settled; and
the usage of the Government has been in harmony
with this settlement. Treasury notes were issued during
the war of 1812, and in the monetary crisis of
1837, also during the war with Mexico, and constantly
since, so that the power to issue them cannot be drawn
into doubt. If there was any doubt originally, unquestioned
practice, sanctioned by successive Congresses,
has completely removed it. I do not stop to consider
whether the power is derived primarily from the power
“to borrow money,” or the power “to regulate commerce,”
or from the unenumerated powers. It is sufficient
that the power exists.</p>

<p>But I see not how to escape the conclusion, that, if
Congress is empowered to issue Treasury notes, it may
affix to these notes such character as shall seem safe
and proper, declaring the conditions of their circulation
and the dues for which they shall be received. Grant
the first power, and the rest must follow. Careful you
will be in the exercise of this power, but, if you choose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
to take the responsibility, I see no check in the Constitution.</p>

<p>The history of our country furnishes testimony, which
has been gathered with extraordinary minuteness in an
elaborate opinion by Mr. Justice Story.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> I follow mainly
his authority, when I set it forth.</p>

<p>It appears that the phrase “bills of credit” was familiarly
used for bank-notes as early as 1683 in England,
and also as early as 1714 in New England. But
the first issue in America was in 1690, by the Colony
of Massachusetts, and the occasion&mdash;identical with the
present&mdash;was to pay soldiers, returning unexpectedly
from an unsuccessful expedition against Canada. These
notes were from two shillings to ten pounds, and were
receivable for dues at the Treasury. Their form was
as follows: “This indented bill of ten shillings, due
from the Massachusetts Colony to the possessor, shall
be in value equal to money, and shall be accordingly
accepted by the Treasurer, and Receivers subordinate to
him, in all public payments, and for any stock at any
time in the Treasury.” Here followed the date, and the
signatures of the Committee authorized to issue these
notes.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Such was their depreciation, that these notes
could not command money or commodities at money
price, although the historian, Hutchinson, who has recorded
these interesting facts, does not hesitate to say
that they had better credit than King James’s leather
money in Ireland only a short time before.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> Being of
small amount, they were soon absorbed in the payment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
of taxes. But this example did not stand alone.</p>

<p>The facility with which paper money is created renders
it difficult to withstand the temptation, unless a
Government is under the restraint of correct principles
of finance, which at that early day were utterly unknown.
An excuse for Massachusetts may be found in the general
poverty at that time, the lack of precious metals,
and the distance from marts of trade. In 1702 there
was another issue of bills of credit, for £15,000, which,
by a subsequent Act, in 1712, were made a tender for
private debts. Under the continued cry of scarcity of
money, bills of credit were again issued in 1716, to the
amount of £150,000, to be lent, for a limited period, to
inhabitants, whose lands were mortgaged as security.
These were not made a tender; but they were receivable
at the Treasury in discharge of taxes, and also of
mortgage debts. Other bills were afterwards issued, so
that paper money was common. The historian who has
exposed this condition of things does not hesitate to
liken this currency to pretended values stamped on
leather or paper, and declared to be receivable in payment
of taxes and in discharge of private debts. The
natural consequence was a fatal depreciation, so that an
ounce of silver, worth in 1702 six shillings and eight
pence, in 1749 was equivalent to fifty shillings of this
paper currency.<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> At the present moment I do not seek
to exhibit the character of this currency, but simply
the original association between bills of credit and the
idea of a tender.</p>

<p>But Massachusetts was not alone. The neighboring
colony of Rhode Island, as early as 1710, followed
her example, and in 1720 made her bills a tender in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
payment of all debts, except certain debts specified.
Connecticut issued bills at different periods, beginning
with 1709, some of which were made a tender, and
some not. New York began in the same year, substantially
following Massachusetts; and her bills were
generally made a tender. In 1722 Pennsylvania issued
bills, secured on mortgage, and made a tender. In
1739 Delaware did likewise, making her bills a tender.
So also did Maryland, in 1733, to the amount of
£90,000; but other bills were issued by Maryland, in
1769, which were not made a tender.</p>

<p>The example of Virginia is more conspicuous, although
not so early in time. The very term, “Treasury
notes,” now used as the equivalent of “bills of credit,”
first appears in her colonial legislation, when, in 1755,
they were made a tender in payment of debts.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> There
were successive emissions in 1769, 1771, and 1773,
which were not made a tender,&mdash;and then in 1778, and
at other times afterwards, which were made a tender.
That these “Treasury notes” were deemed “bills of
credit” is demonstrated by the legislation of the State,
especially by the Act of May, 1780, which, after reciting
that the exigencies of the war require the further emission
of paper money, authorizes new “Treasury notes,”
and proceeds to punish with death any person who shall
forge “any bill of credit <em>or</em> Treasury note to be issued
by virtue of this Act.”<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>I find that North Carolina, as early as 1748, sent
forth bills of credit which were made a tender, and
many subsequent emissions were authorized. South
Carolina began in 1703; but these bills, bearing interest
at twelve per cent, do not seem to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
made a tender. Others issued by this colony, at different
times afterwards, were made a tender. In 1760
Georgia authorized bills of credit on interest, and secured
by mortgage of the property of the receivers,
which were made a tender.</p>

<p>The extensive employment of paper money in New
England aroused the jealousy of the Imperial Parliament,
which, by the Act of 25th June, 1751,<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> expressly
forbade the issue of any “paper bills, or bills of credit,”
except for certain specific purposes, or upon certain
specified emergencies. The Act constantly speaks of
these two as equivalent expressions, thus seeming to
show that “bills of credit,” in their true meaning, were
what is familiarly called “paper money,” with the incidents
of such money. But the Act proceeds to limit
these incidents by declaring expressly that “no paper
currency, or bills of credit,” issued under it, shall be a
tender in payment of any private debts or contracts
whatsoever, with a proviso that nothing therein contained
should make any bills then subsisting a tender.
That Parliament should deem it necessary, by
special enactment, to take from bills of credit the character
of a tender, attests the customary association between
these two ideas.</p>

<p>During the Revolutionary War, under the exigencies
of that time, with a country without resources and a
treasury without money, bills of credit, known as Continental
money, were issued by Congress. But, while
receivable in discharge of taxes and other public dues,
they were not made a tender by Congress, although the
States were recommended to make them such.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Collamer.</span> And did make them so.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> At the adoption of the National Constitution,
the people, to their wide-spread cost, had become
familiar with bills of credit and their incidents,
while all conversant with Colonial history must have
known the part which bills of credit played for nearly
a century, not only as a help to currency, but as a tender,
constituting paper money. And yet, with all this
ample knowledge,&mdash;present certainly to the framers
of the Constitution, if not to the people,&mdash;no express
words on this subject were introduced into the text of
the Constitution, except with regard to the States. The
conclusion from this silence, under all the circumstances,
is strong, if not irresistible.</p>

<p>But the omission of the Constitution with regard to
bills of credit was practically supplied by Congress,
which has not hesitated to assume the existence of the
power. If the Constitution failed to speak, Congress
has not failed; and the exercise of this power cannot
now be questioned, without unsettling our whole financial
system. But we have seen that throughout our
Colonial history the tender was a constant, though not
inseparable, incident of the bill of credit,&mdash;that, indeed,
it was so much part of the bill of credit that the Imperial
Parliament positively interfered to separate the two,
and, while sanctioning the bill of credit, forbade the
tender. And now, if this historical review is properly
apprehended, if it is not entirely out of place, it
must conduct to the conclusion, that, whatever may be
the present question of policy, the power to make Treasury
notes a tender has precisely the same origin in the
Constitution with the power to create Treasury notes.
It is true that you may exercise one power and decline
the other; but if you assume the power to issue bills of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
credit, I am at a loss to understand how you can deny
the power to make them a tender. The two spring from
the same fountain. You may refuse to exercise one or
both; but you cannot insist upon one, under the Constitution,
and reject the other.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Assuming the constitutionality of this proposition, or
rather declining to admit the satisfactory force of the
constitutional arguments against it, I am brought to a
question which has, for me, more of difficulty and doubt:
I mean the policy of exercising the power at this moment.
It is not too much to say that this question
concerns the national character, as well as the national
welfare, while intelligent and patriotic men differ earnestly
with regard to it. Decide it as we may, we cannot
escape anxiety on the subject. Take which way
we will, we cannot escape the just sense of responsibility.
Seeking the truth only, and jealous of that good
name which is to a Government one of its best possessions,
I shall consider the question frankly; nor shall I
disguise any of the difficulties which it presents, whether
from principle or from experience. This is not the time
for concealment, and I insist, that, if the power is exercised,
its true character shall be understood. I invoke,
also, the examples of history, to make us pause; but it
will be my duty to show that there are other examples
calculated to sustain the Government in the policy it
now so urgently recommends.</p>

<p>If the Treasury notes of the United States were at
this moment convertible into coin, there would be no
occasion to declare them a tender; for they would be
everywhere, at least in our own country, as good as
coin. But the suspension of the banks was followed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
suspension of the Treasury, and its notes are now inconvertible
paper, which it is proposed to sustain artificially
by declaring them a tender. If this proposition be
adopted, the Treasury will be enabled to substitute bits
of engraved paper for money. Of course, such a proposition,
on its face, is obnoxious to objections that make
upon me an impression not to be disguised.</p>

<p>Looking at the history of paper money, especially in
our own country, we find no encouragement. Its evils
were vividly portrayed by the “Federalist,”<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> and have
been powerfully presented in this debate by the Senator
from Vermont [Mr. <span class="smcap">Collamer</span>]. Congress, during the
Revolution, began, as early as 1775, with bills to the
amount of $3,000,000, on their face declaring the bearer
entitled to receive the sum specified in “Spanish milled
dollars, or the value thereof in gold or silver,” according
to a certain resolution of Congress. The bills were receivable
for taxes, and the thirteen colonies were pledged
for their redemption. Other emissions followed, and, as
their credit began to fail, Congress went so far as to declare
that whoever refused to receive this paper in payment
should “be deemed, published, and treated as an
enemy of his country.”<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> As the paper continued to depreciate,
Congress became more violent in its support,
and even ventured to recommend it as of peculiar value.
“Let it be remembered,” said Congress, “that paper money
is the only kind of money which cannot ‘make unto
itself wings and fly away.’”<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> The sum-total of these
bills at last reached upwards of three hundred millions,
which in 1780 became so utterly worthless in the hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
of their possessors that they ceased to circulate, and
have ever since been treated only as curiosities, without
positive value. No serious proposition for their redemption
has ever been made.</p>

<p>The French <i>assignats</i>, amounting to the enormous
sum-total of <em>nine thousand million dollars</em>,<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> issued
during the fiery excitements of the Great Revolution,
shared the fortunes of American Continental money,
passing into the limbo of “things transitory and vain.”
Perhaps there is not a country on the European continent,
which, during the fearful wars that followed, did
not encounter the same experience. I have heard it
said that old soldiers in Denmark lighted their pipes
with paper money, which had become to them only
the record of a broken promise.</p>

<p>Power of all kinds is liable to abuse, and experience
shows that the power to issue inconvertible paper is no
exception to this prevailing law. The issue may be
moderate at first, and sustained by plausible reasons, but
it breaks soon into excess. Of course, actual value, or
its equivalent, is the life of money, giving to it a circulating
quality; and when money begins to be suspected,
it loses its circulating quality. But inconvertible
paper, even when made a tender, has no actual
value, and circulates only because Government commands
its circulation. It has no present worth beyond
the engraving; therefore all ordinary checks to undue
issue of money are wanting. Nothing exists to prevent
excess and consequent depreciation; and this danger
is verified by history. I refer to it now that I may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
not seem indifferent to any of the perplexities which
surround us.</p>

<p>In some countries a legal tender is gold and silver;
in others it is gold alone. In England, since 1816, gold,
and not silver, has been the tender for sums of forty
shillings and upwards; and since 1833 the notes of the
Bank have been a tender for sums over five pounds,
everywhere except at the Bank itself and its branches.
But it is to be borne in mind that both these metals
have positive value in the market equivalent to that of
coin; so that coin is value itself. But convertible paper
is not value itself; it is only the representative of value;
while it is doubtful if inconvertible paper can be called
the representative of anything in particular. These considerations
are not decisive of the policy now proposed,
but they justly incline us to a prudent hesitation.</p>

<p>If we are not deterred by the bad examples of history,
or by the acknowledged danger of excess and consequent
depreciation,&mdash;if we are willing to take the chance of
seeing Treasury notes in the same list with Continental
money and French <i>assignats</i>, and of having returned
soldiers in old age light their pipes with the worthless
paper,&mdash;if these suggestions are put aside as exaggerated
or irrelevant, I ask you not to forget that a constant
aim of good government is to secure the immediate convertibility
of paper into coin. But, instead of securing
such immediate convertibility, or taking any steps towards
it, you will for the present renounce it.</p>

<p>Pardon my frankness, Sir, if I declare that the present
proposition, when examined carefully, seems too much
like bad faith. I say it <em>seems</em>: I would not speak too
strongly. Is there not bad faith towards creditors, who
are compelled to receive what is due in a depreciated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
currency? Is there not bad faith towards all abroad,
who, putting trust in our integrity, national and personal,
have sent their money to this country in gold or
its equivalent? And just in proportion as this is so,
you cannot doubt that we shall suffer alike in character
and resources too; for what resource is greater to a nation
or to an individual than a character for integrity?
The present proposition must be followed soon by others,&mdash;even
to the extent of $1,000,000,000. But where
shall this vast amount be obtained, and at what cost,
when it is seen that we have already undertaken to
authorize inconvertible paper as a tender? Credit is
volatile and sensitive, and will not yield to force. Do
you propose the right way to win the delicate possession?
It will not come to you from abroad, where
money usually abounds. Will it salute you here at
home? And is it good economy to obtain the amount
you seek by a policy which will create a disturbing
impediment to all your efforts for the larger amounts
soon to be required? I put these questions without
answering them. It is sufficient for me that I open
the difficulties before us; and here I follow the Senator
from Maine [Mr. <span class="smcap">Fessenden</span>], Chairman of the Committee
on Finance, who commenced this debate.</p>

<p>In courts of law, experts are summoned to testify on
questions of science or art within their special knowledge.
If, on this occasion, experts in finance or currency
were summoned, I do not know that we should
be much enlightened; for, according to my observation,
there are such differences among them, and, as the Senator
from Maine [Mr. <span class="smcap">Fessenden</span>] has pleasantly told
us, such differences even in the same person, one day
and the day after, that it is difficult to place reli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>ance in
their counsels. Some tell us that making Treasury notes
a tender will be most beneficent; others insist that it
will be dishonorable and pernicious. On each side strong
words are employed. Which shall we follow?</p>

<p>Crossing the sea, we find similar differences, not, of
course, with regard to the present proposition, which is
not yet known there, but with regard to the principles
entering into this debate. In England the general subject
has occupied much attention. As late as 1857 it
was brought before a distinguished Parliamentary Committee,
and their Report is remarkable for the testimony
of numerous witnesses whose experience and knowledge
give authority to their opinions. The Report is a financial
monument. But among these witnesses are some
who were little disturbed by an inconvertible currency,
although the weight of testimony was the other way.</p>

<p>Nobody was more positive than Nathaniel Alexander,
Esq., head of the firm of Alexander &amp; Co., India
merchants. His attention being called to the proper
means against the effects of panic on the Bank of
England, he proposed, as an assistance to the Bank,
another currency, inconvertible, and a tender for Government
dues, under Act of Parliament. From its inconvertible
character, such a currency, he said, would
not be reached by panic, and would therefore contribute
to the security of the Bank.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> This testimony seems
to maintain the principle of the present proposition;
and I quote it, as showing that the proposition is not
entirely without practical authority.</p>

<p>John Twells, Esq., a London banker for upwards of
fifty years, also testified in favor of an inconvertible
note under sanction of Government, and a legal tender.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
Here are his answers to two questions.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“What do you conceive to be the advantage of an inconvertible
note of that kind over a convertible note payable to
bearer on demand?&mdash;It would prevent a drain of bullion,
when it is required for foreign trade; and it would give us,
what is so very essential, a domestic currency which is not
influenced by any foreign transactions whatever. If France
or America wants a quantity of gold, it ought not to interfere
with our domestic currency. Our merchants and all our
trade surely should not suffer because America wants gold.</p>

<p>“Do you think that that currency would run the risk of
ever being depreciated in value,&mdash;that is to say, that inconvertible
five pound notes would not exchange for five sovereigns?&mdash;I
do not know, as compared with sovereigns;
that, I think, is of no consequence in the world. We want
it for our internal commerce, and we want it to pay Government
their taxes.”<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Two other questions and answers may be given.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“You have been asked about the French assignats. Is
not the difference between the currency which you recommend
and the assignats just this, that the Government are
bound to take back whatever they issue?&mdash;Precisely; and
that makes all the difference.</p>

<p>“And, with the French assignats, they refused to take
back what they had issued?&mdash;Yes. A corrupt Government
may commit such an excess as they did in France, where
the amount of their assignats was, if I remember right,
about £300,000,000 sterling. They could not receive them
back; they could not get their taxation, on account of the
revolution which was going on; therefore the assignats fell
to nothing.”<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Another witness was Mr. Edward Capps, who described
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>himself as engaged in the surveying and building
trade for thirty years, so that his attention had
been directed to the influence of credit on the manner
in which buildings are erected in London. He, too,
testified in favor of inconvertible paper. Here are some
of his answers.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Would you recommend the issue of an inconvertible
paper currency, with the view of remedying the evils which
you describe?&mdash;I was present and heard the examination
of Mr. Twells, and he was mentioning a project, by which
he thought, that, instead of the £14,000,000 of paper which
the Bank issues upon securities, you might go to the extent
of £20,000,000 of an inconvertible paper. I think I
understood the proposition rightly, as being to that effect.
Though it is not exactly the proposition which I should
make, yet I cannot see any objection to that proposition
myself.”<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>“Do you believe that the paper which you recommend
would be, on the average, of the same value as the present
bank-note, which is convertible into gold?&mdash;I think that
very shortly it would be of a higher value than our present
standard. If any person had to be paid £10,000 fifteen
years hence, and had the option whether it should be paid
in that way or in the standard of gold, I think he would
exercise a wise discretion in choosing the paper.”<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>“You are not in favor of what is called inconvertible
paper, in the sense of worthless paper, are you?&mdash;Not
at all.</p>

<p>“How do you distinguish between your paper and the
rags which have in other cases been issued?&mdash;Unless I
know the principle, I cannot say.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>

<p>“Take the French assignats.&mdash;The French assignats were
issued upon no principle at all, because no provision was
made for their redemption.”<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Against these witnesses was the testimony of a person
perhaps the highest living authority on this question.
I refer to Lord Overstone, known before his
elevation to the peerage as Mr. Jones Loyd, the eminent
banker, whose life makes him practically acquainted
with this subject, while his liberal studies
and various experience add to the solidity of his judgment.
His testimony on this occasion, extending over
almost three days, occupies nearly one hundred folio pages.
Writers on finance have quoted it ever since, and
practical men have accepted it as a guide. In reply to
questions by the Committee, he declared himself strongly
opposed to the issue of Government notes not payable
in specie on demand. In his opinion “they would
generate a state of utter confusion which could not be
tolerated for three months.”<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> Then again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is quite clear that there would be a discount upon
these notes in the first place; they would not answer the
purpose of a circulating medium; it would throw everything
into confusion in the very first stage of the process:
that would be the first difficulty.”<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here are his answers to other questions.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Your Lordship was asked, on the last day, whether it
would not be possible in a great degree to mitigate such
difficulties as I have endeavored to portray, by having two
sorts of notes, one of them payable in bullion, but the other,
if I may use the expression, a sort of I O U note between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>the Government and the public; whether, inasmuch as the
Government owes £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 every quarter,
in the shape of dividends or expenses, and the country
owes £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 of taxes, it would not be
possible to arrange that there should be two sorts of currency
afloat,&mdash;one the common banking note, payable in
bullion, and applicable for all general purposes, and the
other a note applicable in the more limited sense?&mdash;Our
affairs would then go on very much in the way that a man
would walk with one of his legs six inches shorter than the
other. One set of notes would circulate at a depreciation,
compared with the other set of notes; hence great inconvenience
and confusion would arise.”<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>“Do you believe, that, if any person had notes which insured
to him the payment of all the Government demands
upon himself, though he had no demands upon him directly,
he would not find numbers of persons who would exchange
those notes for him at a premium or a discount?&mdash;Then you
would have a certain proportion of the monetary system of
the country circulating at a discount. I cannot conceive a
greater state of monetary disorganization than that.”<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But the testimony of Lord Overstone, strong as it
was, against an inconvertible currency, still admitted a
possible occasion for departure from it; and here his
testimony bears directly on the pending proposition.
Alluding to the well-known suspension of specie payments
by the Bank of England in 1797, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am bound to say that with regard to that period of
1797 there are circumstances which may make it doubtful
whether the Suspension Act was not a justifiable measure.
The pressure in 1797 was undoubtedly, to a considerable
extent, <em>connected with political alarm, with the fear of foreign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>invasion</em>, causing an internal demand for the exchange of
notes into coin. <em>Under such circumstances, there is no measure
founded upon principle which can pretend to afford an adequate
protection. If, for instance, at this moment, this country
were suddenly exposed to the calamity of a very large foreign
force occupying its soil, or if it were exposed to the calamity of
a very formidable and serious civil insurrection</em>, no doubt a
state of panic alarm with regard to the paper money might
arise, against which no provisions of the Act of 1844, nor
any provisions founded upon principle, could possibly afford
an adequate protection. But from that view of the subject,
again, there is an inference to be drawn of a very instructive
and warning character, namely,&mdash;to make this Committee
very cautious how they extend the issues upon securities.
The only protection against such contingencies is the existence
of a large amount of coin, or of bullion, in the country;
and therefore, when we are looking to contingencies of that
nature, we may very properly pause at the questionable recommendation
of increasing our issues upon securities, which
is, in other words, diminishing our issues upon bullion.”<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

</div>

<p>If this authoritative testimony be accepted in favor
of a constant specie currency, it is unquestionably important
as recognizing grounds of exception,&mdash;as, according
to the language of the witness, if the country
were “suddenly exposed to the calamity of a very large
foreign force occupying its soil, or to the calamity of
a very formidable and serious civil insurrection.” In
these exceptions there is matter for much reflection.
Strong as we may be against any questionable currency,
we must not be insensible to a possible limitation
even of this just principle. In short, we must be
content with the best we can command. And here history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
affords valuable illustrations in conformity with
this testimony.</p>

<p>In 1745, the alarm occasioned by the advance of the
Highlanders, under the Pretender, as far as Derby, led
to a run upon the Bank of England; and in order to
gain time, the directors, while continuing to pay in
specie, adopted the device of paying in shillings and
sixpences. But, next to the retreat of the enemy, their
best relief was found in a resolution by the merchants
and traders of the city, declaring their willingness to
receive bank-notes in payment of any sum due, and
pledging their utmost endeavors to make all payments
in these bank-notes. This proceeding, it is perceived,
was prompted by the pressure of civil disturbance.
But the most authentic case is that of 1797, when
the Bank, under pressure of political events, was prohibited,
by Order in Council, <em>issued on Sunday</em>, the
26th of February, from paying their notes in cash, until
the sense of Parliament should be taken on the subject.
At the meeting of Parliament, after much discussion, it
was agreed to continue the suspension till six months
after the signature of a definitive treaty of peace, <em>thus
positively recognizing the existence of war as a reason for
this departure from principle</em>. A recent English writer
vindicates this act as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Much difference of opinion has existed with respect to
the policy of the restriction in 1797; but, considering the
peculiar circumstances under which it took place, its expediency
seems abundantly obvious. The run did not originate
in any over-issue of bank paper, <em>but grew entirely out of
political causes. So long as the alarms of invasion continued,
it was clear that no bank paper immediately convertible into
gold would remain in circulation.</em> And as the Bank, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>possessed of ample funds, was without the means of instantly
retiring her notes, she might, but for the interference
of Government, have been obliged to stop payments,&mdash;an
event, which, had it occurred, might have produced consequences
fatal to the public interests. The error of the
Government did not consist in their coming to the assistance
of the Bank, <em>but in continuing the restriction after the alarm
of invasion had ceased</em>, and there was nothing to hinder the
Bank from safely reverting to specie payments.”<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Unhappily, the definitive treaty of peace, on which
the restoration of specie payments depended, was not
consummated till 1815, so that throughout this long period
there was an inconvertible currency, which even
the sanction of Parliament did not save, in 1814, from
a discount of twenty-five per cent. But peace did not
bring specie at once. The routine of paper had become
too strongly fixed, and it was only through the remarkable
efforts of Sir Robert Peel, in 1819, that an Act of
Parliament was passed requiring the payment of specie
at the Bank in 1823. Such is the practical testimony
of British experience.</p>

<p>The experience of France is similar. I do not now
refer to the old <i>assignats</i>, but to a modern instance.
Beyond question, the Bank of France is conducted with
caution and skill; but no caution and skill are adequate
to counteract the influence of a sudden revolution, especially
like that of 1848, when the Republic was declared.
The Bank made large advances to the Provisional Government.
This obligation, combined with distrust universally
prevalent, occasioned so severe a drain of gold,
that, to prevent the total exhaustion of its vaults, the
Bank was authorized by Government decree of 16th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
March, 1848,&mdash;just three weeks after the Revolution,&mdash;to
suspend specie payments, while its notes were
at the same time made a legal tender. To prevent
abuse, possible in such a condition of things, a maximum
of issues was fixed at three hundred and fifty
million francs. Such precautions were proper; but the
fact of the authorized suspension remains an example
of history. The prompt return to the true system is
not without encouragement.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If these instances are entitled to consideration, they
seem to show, that, according to the experience of other
countries, Government may be compelled at times to
relax the rigor of its requirements with regard to convertible
paper. But they do not fix the limitation to
the exercise of this extraordinary discretion. That the
discretion exists is important in the present debate.</p>

<p>It is a discretion kindred to that under which the
<i>Habeas Corpus</i> is suspended, so that citizens are arrested
without the forms of law,&mdash;kindred to that under which
an extensive territory is declared to be in a condition of
insurrection, so that all business with its inhabitants
is suspended,&mdash;kindred to that which unquestionably
exists, to obtain soldiers, if necessary, by draft or conscription
instead of the free offering of volunteers,&mdash;kindred
to that under which private property is taken
for public uses,&mdash;and kindred, also, to that undoubted
discretion which sanctions the completest exercise of
the transcendent right of self-defence.</p>

<p>But, while recognizing the existence of the discretion
in the last resort, under the law of necessity, the question
still remains if this necessity actually exists. And
now, as I close, I shall not cease to be frank. Is i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>t necessary
to incur all the unquestionable evils of inconvertible
paper, forced into circulation by Act of Congress,&mdash;to
suffer the stain upon our national faith, to
bear the stigma of a seeming repudiation, to lose for the
present that credit which in itself is a treasury, and to
teach debtors everywhere that contracts may be varied
at the will of the stronger? Surely there is much in
these inquiries to make us pause. If our country were
poor or feeble, without population and without resources,
if it were already drained by a long war, if the enemy
had succeeded in depriving us of the means of livelihood,
then we should not even pause. But our country
is rich and powerful, with a numerous population,
busy, honest, and determined, abounding in unparalleled
resources of all kinds, agricultural, mineral, industrial,
and commercial; it is yet undrained by the war
in which we are engaged, nor has the enemy succeeded
in depriving us of any means of livelihood. It is hard,
very hard, to think that such a country, so powerful,
so rich, and so beloved, should be compelled to adopt
a policy of even questionable propriety.</p>

<p>If I mention these things, if I make these inquiries, it
is because of the unfeigned solicitude which I feel with
regard to this measure, and not with the view of arguing
against the exercise of a constitutional power, when, in
the opinion of the Government to which I give my confidence,
the necessity for its exercise has arrived. Surely
we must all be against paper money, we must all insist
upon maintaining the integrity of the Government, and
we must all set our faces against any proposition like
the present, except as a temporary expedient, rendered
imperative by the exigency of the hour. If it has my
vote, it will be only because I am unwilling to refuse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
the Government especially charged with this responsibility
that confidence which is hardly less important
to the public interests than the money itself. Others
may doubt if the exigency is sufficiently imperative;
but the Secretary of the Treasury, whose duty it is to
understand the occasion, does not doubt. In his opinion
the war requires this sacrifice. Uncontrollable passions
are let loose to overturn the tranquil conditions of
peace. Meanwhile your soldiers in the field must be
paid and fed. There can be no failure or postponement.
A remedy is proposed which at another moment you
would reject. Whatever the national resources, they are
not now within reach, except by summary process. Reluctantly,
painfully, I consent that the process shall
issue.</p>

<p>And yet I cannot give such a vote without warning
the Government against the dangers from such an experiment.
The medicine of the Constitution must not
become its daily bread. Nor can I disguise the conviction
that better than any device of legal tender will be
vigorous, earnest efforts for the suppression of the Rebellion,
and the establishment of the Constitution in its
true principles over the territory which the Rebellion
has usurped.</p>

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>January 6, 1862, the credentials of Hon. Benjamin Stark as Senator
of Oregon were presented, when Mr. Fessenden, of Maine, moved
that the oath be not administered at present, and that the credentials,
together with certain papers which he offered, be referred to the Committee
on the Judiciary. These papers, according to him, stated that
Mr. Stark was understood by everybody in his vicinity to be an open
and avowed supporter of Secession,&mdash;that he had openly defended the
course of the South in seceding, and given utterance to sentiments totally
at war with the institutions and the preservation of our country,
such as approving the attack on Fort Sumter, making declarations to
the effect, that, in the event of civil war, which, in fact, had already
commenced, he would sell his property in Oregon and go South and
join the Rebels,&mdash;that the Rebels were right,&mdash;that the Davis Government
was, in fact, the only Government left,&mdash;that there was, in fact,
no Government of the Union at all. Mr. Fessenden added, that numerous
declarations of this kind were sworn to by persons certified and
proved to his satisfaction to be perfectly reliable. In the course of the
debate, Mr. Fessenden further remarked: “Now, Sir, I do not hesitate
to say, that, if a part only of what is stated in these papers is true,
I presume the Senator from Indiana [Mr. <span class="smcap">Bright</span>] himself would vote
upon the instant to expel this gentleman from the body, if he had taken
the oath.”<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>The motion of Mr. Fessenden was opposed by Mr. Bayard, of Delaware,
and Mr. Bright, of Indiana, the latter objecting especially that
the motion was without precedent. Here Mr. Sumner spoke briefly,
presenting the point on which he subsequently enlarged.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>I desire, Mr. President, to make one single remark.
It is said that the proposition before the Senate is without
precedent. New occasions teach new duties; precedents
are made when the occasion requires. Never
before has any person appeared to take a seat in this
body whose previous conduct and declarations, as disclosed
to the Senate, gave reasonable ground to distrust
his loyalty. That case, Sir, is without precedent. It behooves
the Senate to make a precedent in such an unprecedented
case. At this very moment we are engaged
in considering if certain Senators shall not be expelled
for disloyalty; and it seems to me we shall do our duty
poorly, if we receive a new comer with regard to whose
loyalty there is reasonable suspicion.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>January 10, the credentials of Mr. Stark and the accompanying motion
were taken up for consideration again, when Mr. Bayard made an
elaborate speech against the motion. Mr. Sumner replied in remarks
which will be found in the <i>Congressional Globe</i>,<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> adducing the case
of Philip Barton Key, a sitting member from Maryland, against whom
it was alleged, that he “either now was or had been a British pensioner,”
and that “an inquiry ought to be had in this matter, as, were
it true, it would certainly be a disqualification.”<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> After further debate,
the motion of Mr. Fessenden prevailed, and the credentials, with
the papers, were referred to the Committee.</p>

<p>February 7th, Mr. Harris, of New York, reported from the Committee,
that, “without expressing any opinion as to the effect of the papers
before them upon any subsequent proceeding in the case,” Mr. Stark
was “entitled to take the constitutional oath of office.” Mr. Trumbull,
Chairman of the Committee, dissented from the report, thinking
it “the duty of the Committee to pass upon the testimony before it in
regard to the loyalty of the Senator from Oregon.”<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>February 18th, the Senate resumed the consideration of this case,
when Mr. Harris spoke in favor of the report, and Mr. Hale, of New
Hampshire, against it. The latter moved that the report be recommitted,
with instructions to inquire whether the evidence so far impeached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>Mr. Stark’s loyalty as to disqualify him from holding a seat
in the Senate. This motion presented the very point raised by Mr.
Sumner at the beginning, and he spoke upon it as follows.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;Over each House of Congress,
while in session, floats the flag of the Union. So
long as that flag ripples above our end of the Capitol,
the passing stranger knows that the Senate is engaged
in loyal service to the Republic. In no other country
is the national flag thus employed; and I remember to
have heard a distinguished artist<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>&mdash;who, unhappily,
no longer lives except in his works, some of which are
near us&mdash;remark that this custom was to him the most
original and picturesque feature of Washington. The national
flag, symbolizing the labors of Congress, seemed
to have a double beauty, reminding him not only of
country, but also of the patriotic service in which those
the people trusted were then engaged.</p>

<p>The Senate is now in session, performing its allotted
duties, and the national flag is over it. I need
not enlarge on these duties, legislative, diplomatic, and
executive. They are present to your minds. Suffice it
to say, that not a law can be passed, not a treaty can
be ratified, not a nomination to office can be confirmed,
without the action of the Senate. And now you are to
determine the plain question, if this body, with these
exalted, various, and most confidential trusts, and actually
sitting beneath the flag of the Union, is so utterly
powerless and abject, that, before admitting a person to
participation in these trusts, it can make no inquiry
with regard to his loyalty, and cannot even consider
evidence tending to show that he is false to the flag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
now waving over us. Sir, if this be so, if the Senate
is really in this condition of imbecility, if its doors must
necessarily swing open to any traitor, even, presenting
himself with a certificate in his pocket, let the flag drop,
and no longer symbolize the loyal service in which we
are engaged. The Report of the Committee, expressed in
simple English, without circumlocution or equivocation,
is, “Free admission to traitors here, and no questions
asked.” In other words, the claimant of a seat in the
Senate can enter and take it without question with regard
to loyalty. He can freely participate in these most
important trusts, with the flag of the Union waving over
him, and nobody shall ask in advance whether he is
true to that flag.</p>

<p>But it is argued by the Senator of New York [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Harris</span>], that the Constitution having provided for
the expulsion of a Senator by a vote of two thirds,
there can be no inquiry on the threshold, except with
regard to the qualifications of age, citizenship, and inhabitancy
of the State whose certificate he bears. If
this be true, then open, flaunting treason is not a disqualification,
and the traitor, if allowed to go at large,
may present his certificate and proceed to occupy a
seat among us. A proposition is sometimes answered
simply by stating it; and it seems to me that this is
done in the present case. The Constitution was the
work of wise and practical men, and they were not
guilty of the absurdity which such an interpretation
attributes to them. They did not announce that a
disloyal man, or, it may be, a traitor, may enter this
Chamber without opposition, and then intrench himself
securely behind the provision requiring a vote of two
thirds for his expulsion; they did not declare that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
mere certificate of a Senator is an all-sufficient passport
to shield a hateful crime itself from every inquiry;
nor did they insist that disloyalty in this high place is
to be treated so tenderly as not even to be touched, until,
perhaps, it is too late. This whole argument, that
the claimant must be admitted to the Senate and then
judged afterwards, is more generous to the claimant than
just to the Senate; it is more considerate of personal
pretensions than of public interests. To admit a claimant
charged with disloyalty, in the hope of expelling
him afterwards, is a voluntary abandonment of the right
of self-defence, which belongs to the Senate as much
as to any individual. The irrational character of such
abandonment is aptly pictured in a Parliamentary speech
reproduced in curious verses, more expressive than poetical,
and once quoted by Mr. Webster:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“I hear a lion in the lobby roar:</div>
<div class="verse">Say, Mr. Speaker, shall we shut the door,</div>
<div class="verse">And keep him there? or shall we let him in,</div>
<div class="verse">To try if we can turn him out again?”<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But the Senate is asked to do this very thing. Instead
of shutting the door and keeping disloyalty out,
we are asked to let it in and see if we can get it out
again.</p>

<p>If we look closely at the Constitution, we cannot
hesitate. It is assumed by the Committee that there
are but three qualifications for a Senator, and these
words are quoted:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“No person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained
to the age of thirty years, and been nine years a
citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when
elected, be an inhabitant of that State for which he shall
be chosen.”</p>

</div>

<p>According to these words, the three qualifications
are (1) age, (2) citizenship, and (3) inhabitancy of the
State he assumes to represent. These qualifications are
not questioned, because they are grouped in a special
clause of the Constitution; and every applicant, on
presenting himself here, is subjected at once to these
tests. But it is a mistake to suppose that these are
the only qualifications imposed. There is another, mentioned
in a later part of the Constitution, more important
than either of the others; so that, though last in
place, it is first in consequence. It is <em>loyalty</em>, which I
affirm is made a qualification under the Constitution;
and we have already seen, that, even if the organic law
were silent, it is so essential to the fitness of a Senator
for his trusts, that the Senate, in the exercise of its discretion,
ought to require it. But the language of the
Constitution leaves no room for doubt.</p>

<p>The words establishing loyalty as a qualification are
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<em>The Senators and Representatives before mentioned …
shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this Constitution.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These words are explicit in requiring the oath to
support the Constitution. And the first statute of the
First Congress, approved June 1, 1789, and standing at
the head of our statute-book, provides for the administration
of the oath as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The oath or affirmation required by the sixth article of
the Constitution of the United States shall be administered
in the form following, to wit: ‘I, A. B., do solemnly swear,
or affirm, (as the case may be,) that I will support the Constitution
of the United States.’ …</p>

<p>“The President of the Senate for the time being shall
also administer the said oath or affirmation to each Senator
who shall hereafter be elected, <em>previous to his taking his
seat</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus by the Constitution, explained by the earliest
statutes, must the oath to support the Constitution be
administered to a Senator <em>previous to his taking his seat</em>.
But the oath is simply evidence and pledge of loyalty;
and this evidence and pledge constitute a condition
precedent to admission. As loyalty is more important
than age or citizenship or inhabitancy, it has been put
under the solemn safeguard of an oath. So far from
agreeing with the Committee, or with the Senator from
New York [Mr. <span class="smcap">Harris</span>], that it is not named among
“qualifications,” it seems to me that it stands first
among them. Of course, it is vain to say that it is
not expressly called a “qualification.” Let us ascend
from words to things. It is made a qualification in
fact, call it by what name you will. Men are familiarly
said to “qualify” for an office, when they take
the necessary oath of office; so that the language of
common life becomes an interpreter of the Constitution.
Sir, loyalty is among constitutional “qualifications”
of a Senator.</p>

<p>Resting on this conclusion, and assuming that disloyalty
is a constitutional disqualification, the single
question remains as to the time when evidence with
regard to it may be considered. Now, as the Senate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>,
under the Constitution, is exclusive judge of the qualifications
of its members, the time when it shall consider
a case is obviously within its own discretion,
according to the exigency. It may take up the case
early or late, before or after the administration of the
oath. Under ordinary circumstances, where the case
turned upon a question of age or citizenship or inhabitancy,
it would be reasonable, and according to usage,
that the claimant should be admitted under his certificate,
which is <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the requisite
qualifications. In such a case the public interests
would not suffer, for the disqualification is rather of
<em>form</em> than of <em>substance</em>. But where the disqualification
is founded on disloyalty, it is obvious that the public
interests might be seriously compromised, if the claimant
were allowed any such privilege,&mdash;for the disqualification
is of <em>substance</em>, and not of <em>form</em>. Disloyalty
must not find a seat in the Senate, even for a day;
nor can any claimant charged with disloyalty complain
that the Senate refuses welcome to its trusts.</p>

<p>The oath required to support the Constitution is
on its face <em>an oath of loyalty</em>, and nothing else. The
claimant may declare willingness to take it; but such
declaration is not an answer to evidence showing disloyalty,
unless you are ready to admit present professions
to be a sufficient cloak for disloyalty, or, it may
be, treason, in the past. On a question of such importance,
with positive evidence against his loyalty,
the claimant cannot expect permission to purge himself
on his oath. The issue is distinctly presented, if
he has not already committed himself, so that his oath
to support the Constitution is entitled to no consideration.
Sir Edward Coke pronounces generally, that “an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
infidel cannot be sworn,”&mdash;a doctrine which has been
since mitigated in our courts. But whatever the rule
on this subject in our courts, it is reasonable that an
<em>infidel</em> to our Government, an infidel to our Constitution,
should not be permitted by the Senate to go
through the mockery of swearing to support the Constitution;
nor should a person charged with such <em>infidelity</em>
be permitted to take the oath, unless able to
remove the grounds of the charge. The oath is administered
by the President of the Senate at your desk,
Sir, in the presence of the Senators; and the solemnity
of the occasion is an additional argument against administering
it to any person whose loyalty is not above
suspicion. There is a German treatise entitled, “<i>On
the Lubricity and Slippery Uncertainty of the Suppletory
Oath</i>,”&mdash;being the oath of a litigant party in his own
case. But an oath to support the Constitution by a
claimant charged with disloyalty would be open to suspicion,
at least, of lubricity and slippery uncertainty
not creditable to the Senate.</p>

<p>We are told in the Epistle to the Hebrews that an
oath is “the end of the whole dispute”;<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> but this of
course assumes that the oath is above question. If not
above question, it is wrong to allow the oath,&mdash;at least
in the Senate of the United States, which is the exclusive
judge of its own proceedings.</p>

<p>I say nothing of the facts in the present case; nor
do I venture to suggest any judgment on the final
weight to which they may be entitled. I confine myself
to the simple question as to the duty of inquiry at the
present stage of proceedings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Trumbull of Illinois, Mr. Dixon of Connecticut, Mr. Davis
of Kentucky, Mr. Clark of New Hampshire, and Mr. Morrill of
Maine followed against the Report, which was sustained by Mr. Carlile
of West Virginia, Mr. McDougall of California, Mr. Ten Eyck of
New Jersey, and Mr. Foster of Connecticut. Mr. Sumner moved that
the resolution of the Committee be amended so as to read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That Benjamin Stark, of Oregon, appointed a Senator of that
State by the Governor thereof, and now charged by affidavits with disloyalty
to the Government of the United States, is not entitled to take

truth of the charge.”</p>

</div>

<p>Here Mr. Sumner remarked:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>It is my earnest hope that the claimant will be able
to purge himself, and show that he is a loyal citizen.
Meanwhile I do not wish to prejudge him; I have not
prejudged him; I have come to no conclusion on the
facts; but I have come to a perfect, fixed, and irreversible
conclusion on the duty of the Senate at this time
to enter into this inquiry, and to ascertain from the
evidence whether he is loyal or not.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Fessenden followed, withdrawing his opposition, and concluded
by avowing his purpose: “When the question appears before me in a
shape that I can vote directly upon it, to vote that the gentleman who
presents his credentials be permitted to take the oath and become a
member of the Senate.”</p>

<p>February 24th, the debate was resumed, when Mr. Howe, of Wisconsin,
spoke in favor of the admission, and Mr. Doolittle against it.</p>

<p>February 26th, Mr. Hale withdrew his proposition, so that the
amendment of Mr. Sumner was in order. He then spoke as follows.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I am unwilling to speak again
in this debate. Nothing but a sense of duty
makes me break silence. But I am determined that
this Chamber of high trust, so carefully guarded by the
Constitution, shall not be opened to disloyalty, if any
argument, any persuasion, or any effort of mine can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
prevent it.</p>

<p>Of course, in this debate something is assumed. It
is simply this: that the evidence touching the loyalty
of the claimant is not valueless; that it merits attention;
that it affords <em>probable cause</em>, if I may adopt the phrase
of the Roman Law, for distrust; that it is enough to put
a party on the defensive. If this be the case, if all these
affidavits, verified by the certificate so numerously signed,
are not put aside as baseless, then the Senate must inquire
into the charge. The result of the inquiry may
be one way or another; but the inquiry must be made.
Not to make it is abandonment of present duty; and
not to assert the power is abandonment of an essential
right of self-defence.</p>

<p>I have listened to the various arguments pressing the
Senate to disarm itself, as they have been presented
by able Senators, especially by the Senator from Maine
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Fessenden</span>] and the Senator from Wisconsin [Mr.
<span class="smcap">Howe</span>]; and I have felt, as I listened, new confidence
in the constitutional power of the Senate to protect itself
at all times against disloyalty, and in the duty to
exercise this constitutional power at any time, early or
late, in its completest discretion.</p>

<p>But it is said,&mdash;and I believe the Senator from Maine
first presented this argument, which has been urged so
strongly by the Senator from Wisconsin,&mdash;that, if we reject
the present claimant, Oregon will be without a representative.
And if we expel him, will not Oregon be
without a representative? Surely this is no reason for
hesitation in either case. I, too, desire a representative
for Oregon; but I know full well that a disloyal representative
is no representative,&mdash;or rather, Sir, is worse
than no representative. In sustaining such a re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>presentative,
you sacrifice substance to form,&mdash;you abandon
the living principle, content with the dead letter,&mdash;you
“keep the word of promise to the ear, and break it to the
hope,”&mdash;you offer to the people of Oregon a stone, when
they demand bread. In the name of the people of Oregon,
whose wishes are manifest in the papers before us,
I protest against the pretension that they can be represented
by a disloyal person. Misrepresentation is not
and never can be representation.</p>

<p>But it is said,&mdash;and I believe the Senator from
Maine made the argument,&mdash;that the evidence against
the claimant, if sustained, might justify expulsion, but
will not justify refusal of admission to take the oath.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Fessenden.</span> The Senator will state my position as I
put it, and that was, if the same language and declarations
were proved as coming from Mr. Stark while a Senator, I
thought they might justify his expulsion.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The Senator says, that, if the same language
had been used while he was a Senator, it might
justify expulsion. That is enough, Sir; and yet the
Senator argues that it will not justify the Senate in
refusing to open its doors, when he presents himself for
admission. In plain terms, the Senate may pronounce
the stigma of expulsion, but not the judgment of exclusion.
A similar absurdity would be to say, that in private
life an offence would justify kicking an intruder
down stairs, but would not justify refusing him admission
to our house. It is enough to state this case.
Nothing can be clearer in the light of reason&mdash;and I
say also of the Constitution&mdash;than that it is the duty
of the Senate to meet disloyalty on the threshold,&mdash;to
say to it, wherever it first shows itself, that this Chamber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
is no place for it. The English orator pictured his
desolation, when he said that he was alone, and had
none to meet his enemies in the gate.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Desolate will
be the Senate, when it cannot meet disloyalty in the
gate.</p>

<p>But the Senator from Maine complains, and the
Senator from Vermont [Mr. <span class="smcap">Collamer</span>] joins in the
complaint, that the claimant is not allowed to <em>purge</em>
himself by his oath,&mdash;thus using a technical phrase
of the law, applicable chiefly to suspected persons. Not
allowed to <em>purge</em> himself! Rather say, Sir, not allowed
to <em>perjure</em> himself. For, in view of the testimony on
your table, the inference is, unhappily, too strong, that
in any oath to support the Constitution he must perjure
himself. I say this with pain, and anxious not to prejudge
the case, but simply because the facts, as they
stand without contradiction, leave no opportunity for
any other conclusion.</p>

<p>Since complaint is made by learned lawyers that the
claimant is not allowed to purge himself, I desire to adduce
a legal analogy on this question. It is well known
that by the Common Law a person is not permitted to
take an oath who does not believe in God. This is the
general principle; but when we look at the application,
we see how completely it illustrates the present case.
If a person is known to have openly and recently declared
disbelief, he will not be permitted to purge himself
by his oath, for the reason that his own declarations
are decisive.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Here Mr. Sumner read from Greenleaf’s <i>Law of Evidence</i>, § 370, and
the note to that section, and then proceeded.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>Here again is additional illustration from the annotations
to the great work of Phillipps on the Law of
Evidence.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“After the incompetency of the witness from defect of
religious belief is satisfactorily established by proof of his
declarations out of court, he will not be permitted to deny
or explain such declarations or his opinions, or to state his
recantation of them, when called to be sworn. But he may
be restored to his competency on giving satisfactory proof
of a change of opinion before the trial, so as to repel any
presumption arising from his previous declarations of infidelity.”<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

</div>

<p>I would not press this illustration too far. But it
seems to me clear, that, if you accept the declarations
of a person as decisive against his religious belief, they
must be accepted as equally decisive with regard to his
political belief. An oath to support the Constitution
presupposes political belief, as much as the oath itself
presupposes religious belief.</p>

<p>Pardon me, Sir, but I cannot refrain from astonishment
that Senators, learned lawyers, should be willing
to treat the oath to support the Constitution as an
oath of <em>purgation</em>, an oath of <em>defecation</em>, an oath of <em>purification</em>,&mdash;by
which a suspected person may cleanse
himself, by which an evil spirit may be cast out. Sir,
it is no such thing. Such is not the oath of the Constitution.
By that oath the accepted Senator dedicates
himself solemnly to the Constitution. It is not an oath
of purgation, as Senators insist, but an oath of consecration.
To such an oath may be fitly applied the words
of the ancients, when they spoke of the oath as “the
greatest pledge of faith among men.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>I would not be carried into technicalities; but, since
Senators insist that this oath is merely of purgation, I
venture to add, that, according to early writers, there
were two forms of oaths,&mdash;one technically styled “the
oath of expurgation,” sometimes the <i>ex officio</i> oath, by
which persons were bound to answer all questions, even
to the extent of accusing themselves or intimate friends.
This oath was much used and abused in the days of
Queen Elizabeth. At an earlier day it was administered
to an Archbishop of York charged with murder, and no
less than one hundred compurgators were sworn with
him. The other is what is called “the promissory
oath,” which is the oath of the sovereign, the magistrate,
the judge, the senator. Obviously this is widely
different from the oath by which a person clears himself
from suspicion, or cleanses his name.</p>

<p>There is another oath, with a peculiar title: I mean
the <em>custom-house oath</em>. You all know something of this
oath, which is taken hastily, without solemnity or question,
and is now an acknowledged nuisance and mockery,
against which people petition Congress. By such
oaths, “sworn is the tongue, but unsworn is the mind.”
With such oaths for seed, perjury is the natural harvest.
If Senators who have spoken in this debate can have
their own way, you will degrade the solemn oath of the
Constitution to the same class, and make it the seed of
similar harvest.</p>

<p>For myself, I am determined, so far as my vote or
voice can go, that the oath shall mean something, and
that it shall be kept solemn and above suspicion. It
shall not be degraded to be an oath of purgation or a
custom-house oath, but shall be in all simplicity what
is regarded by the Constitution an oath of office, in
itself the pure and truthful expression of assured lo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>yalty,&mdash;not
of loyalty still in question, still doubtful, so
that people openly testify against it. And where there
is evidence seriously impeaching the loyalty of a claimant,
he shall not take that oath, with my consent, until
the impeachment is removed. Sir, I am not insensible
to the attractions of comedy, when well performed on
the stage; but there is a place for everything, and I am
unwilling to sit in my seat here and witness the comedy
proposed. The Senate is to resolve itself into a theatre,
under the management of grave Senators,&mdash;the
Senator from New York, the Senator from Maine, and
other Senators,&mdash;and we are to see the play proceed.
The claimant from Oregon crosses the floor, and, under
honorable escort, approaches the desk, takes the oath,
and kisses the book. The title of the play is borrowed
from a forgotten old English drama: “Treason made
Easy; or, An Oath no Great Thing.”</p>

<p>It ill becomes the Senate at this moment to do or to
forbear anything by which the standard of loyalty can
be lowered. If it justly expects loyalty from others, if
it requires loyalty in its soldiers and officers, surely it
ought to set an example in its own members. Toward
itself, at least, it cannot be too austere in requirement.
Wherever about us disloyalty shows itself, whether in
the Senate or in its lobby, whether already intrenched
in this Chamber or struggling to enter in, whether
planted at these desks or still standing in the gate,
we have one and the same duty to perform. We must
inquire into its character, and if it be found unworthy
of trust, we must chastise it or exclude it. This is the
least we can do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sumner was followed the same day by Mr. McDougall, Mr.
Davis, Mr. Cowan, Mr. Carlile, Mr. Sherman, Mr. Harris, all in favor
of admission, and by Mr. Wilmot, Mr. Trumbull, Mr. Dixon, against it.</p>

<p>February 27th, Mr. Browning spoke in favor of admission, Mr. Howard
against it.</p>

<p>The vote was then taken on the amendment of Mr. Sumner, and it
was lost,&mdash;yeas 18, nays 26.</p>

<p>The question recurred on the resolution of the Committee, which
was adopted, yeas 26, nays 19; and Mr. Stark was admitted to take
the oath.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The same question came up again in another form.</p>

<p>April 22d, the Committee to whom were referred the papers touching
the disloyalty of Mr. Stark reported that “the Senator from Oregon is
disloyal to the Government of the United States.”</p>

<p>May 7th, Mr. Sumner introduced the following resolution:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That Benjamin Stark, a Senator from Oregon, who has been
found by a committee of this body to be disloyal to the Government of the
United States, be, and the same is hereby, expelled from the Senate.”</p>

</div>

<p>June 5th, Mr. Sumner moved that the Senate proceed with the consideration
of this resolution, and explained it briefly.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;The Senate will observe that the
resolution declares that the Senator from Oregon has
been found by a Committee of the Senate to be disloyal.
Now, Sir, I have no desire to discuss the facts of this
case. But, in order to exhibit the urgency of this question,
it is my duty to exhibit the conclusions of the
Committee, set forth in their Report, as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“1st. That for many months prior to the 21st November,
1861, and up to that time, the said Stark was an ardent advocate
of the cause of the rebellious States.</p>

<p>“2d. That, after the formation of the Constitution of
the Confederate States, he openly declared his admiration for
it, and advocated the absorption of the loyal States of the
Union into the Southern Confederacy, under that Constitution,
as the only means of peace, warmly avowing his sympathies
with the South.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>

<p>“3d. That the Senator from Oregon is disloyal to the
Government of the United States.”</p>

</div>

<p>Of these propositions the first two had the sanction
of the Senator from Virginia [Mr. <span class="smcap">Willey</span>], while all
three had the sanction of the rest of the Committee,
being the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>],
the Senator from Indiana [Mr. <span class="smcap">Wright</span>], the Senator
from Michigan [Mr. <span class="smcap">Howard</span>], and the Senator from
Ohio [Mr. <span class="smcap">Sherman</span>]. Thus, in a Special Committee of
five, raised expressly to consider this case, raised, too,
after protracted discussion in the Senate, four of the
Committee united in all the conclusions of the Report,
and the dissenting member united in the first two conclusions.
And this Report is, if possible, entitled to
additional consideration, when it is known that the
Senator from Oregon himself appeared before the Committee.
On these accounts I accept the Report, and do
not wish to go into it or behind it. It is with me the
solemn verdict of a jury duly impanelled for the trial
of a cause.</p>

<p>But if the Committee is the jury, the Senate is the
court; and it remains that judgment should be entered.</p>

<p>I hear a voice saying that we must not take time for
this question. Pray, Sir, what time is needed? The
time has been already taken. The hearing has been
had, the verdict is rendered.</p>

<p>Pray, why not take time? We are engaged in war
to put down disloyalty. For this we set armies in the
field, and contend in battle with our own fellow-citizens.
For this we incur untold debts. For this we are preparing
to incur untold taxation. Sir, all this is simply
to put down disloyalty. And yet, when a committee
of this body, after careful inquiry, solemnly declares a
Senator disloyal to the National Government, we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
told that there is no time to consider the question.
Sir, I am against disloyalty, wherever it shows itself,
whether in belligerent States, sheltered and strengthened
by numbers, or sitting here, with all the privileges of
this Chamber. Others will do as they please; but I
cannot remain silent, while disloyalty, already exposed
by our own Committee, is allowed a seat in our councils,
open and secret. In not acting, you will discredit the
Report of the Committee, or show that the Senate is
indifferent to the character of its members. I will
have no part in any such thing.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The Senate refused to consider the resolution.</p>

<p>June 6th, Mr. Sumner again moved to proceed with the resolution,
urging, that, with the Report of the Committee on the table affirming
his disloyalty, it was the duty of the Senate to act promptly.</p>

<p>The question, being taken by yeas and nays, resulted, yeas 16, nays
21. So the motion was not agreed to.</p>

<h2><a name="HELP_FOR_MEXICO_AGAINST_FOREIGN_INTERVENTION" id="HELP_FOR_MEXICO_AGAINST_FOREIGN_INTERVENTION"></a>HELP FOR MEXICO AGAINST FOREIGN INTERVENTION.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Report from the Committee of Foreign Relations upon the
Draught of a Convention with Mexico, February 19, 1862.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>A convention was made at London, October 31, 1861, between
Great Britain, France, and Spain, professedly to obtain redress and
security from Mexico for citizens of the three contracting powers.
Provision was made for the accession of the United States as a fourth
party; but the note inviting us to join was dated a month after the
Convention. The invitation was declined. But, anxious to help
Mexico, Mr. Seward proposed pecuniary aid, in the hope of enabling
our neighbor republic to satisfy the demands of the invading allies, so
far at least as to make them withdraw. The draught of such a Convention
with Mexico was transmitted to the Senate, who were asked to give
their advice with regard to it.</p>

<p>A few passages of a letter from Mr. Corwin to Mr. Sumner, dated at
Mexico, April 14, 1862, will show the condition of things there.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The general and leading objects of my mission to Mexico were, first, to
prevent the Southern Confederacy from obtaining any recognition here, and
thus cut off the hope of augmenting the power of the South by acquisition,
accompanied with Slavery, in Mexico, or any of the Southern Spanish-American
republics; secondly, to use every proper means to prevent European
power from gaining a permanent hold upon this part of the American Continent.</p>

<p>“In the first object I have fully succeeded. The Southern Commissioner,
after employing persuasion and threats, finally took his leave of the city,
sending back from Vera Cruz, as I am informed, a very offensive letter to
the Government here. In obtaining the second end I have had more difficulty.…</p>

<p>“If the French attempt to conquer this country, it is certain to bring on a
war of two or three years’ duration. The gorges of the mountains, so frequent
here, afford to small detachments stronger holds than any position
fortified by art; and the Mexicans have a strong hatred of foreign rule,
which animates the whole body of the people. I trust our Government will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>remonstrate firmly against all idea of European conquest on this continent,
and in such time as to have its due influence on the present position of
France in Mexico.…</p>

<p>“But I am satisfied this danger may be avoided by the pecuniary aid
proposed by the present treaty with us, and the united diplomacy of England,
Spain, and the United States. If these means are not promptly and
energetically applied, a European power may fasten itself upon Mexico,
which it will become a necessity with us, at no distant day, to dislodge.
To do this, in the supposed event, would cost us millions twenty times told
more than we now propose to lend upon undoubted security.”</p>

</div>

<p>Spain and England soon withdrew from coöperation, leaving the
French Emperor alone to pursue the unhappy enterprise, which ended
in the sacrifice of Maximilian, whom he had placed on the Mexican
throne.</p>

</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">The Committee on Foreign Relations, to whom was referred
a Message from the President, of December 17, 1861,
transmitting a Draught for a Convention with the Republic
of Mexico, with accompanying papers, and a Message
from the President, of January 24, 1862, transmitting a
Despatch from Mr. Corwin, Minister at Mexico, have had
the same under consideration, and report.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">On the 2d of September, 1861, Mr. Seward, in a despatch
to Mr. Corwin, at Mexico, announced that
the President greatly desired the political status of Mexico
as an independent nation to be permanently maintained;
that the events communicated by Mr. Corwin
alarmed him, and he conceived that the people of the
United States would scarcely justify him, were he to
make no effort for preventing so great a calamity on
this continent as would be the extinction of that neighbor
republic; that he had therefore empowered Mr. Corwin
to negotiate a treaty with Mexico for the assumption
by the United States of the interest, at three per
cent, upon the funded debt of that country, the principal
of which was understood to be about sixty-two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
millions of dollars, for the term of five years from the
date of the decree recently issued by Mexico suspending
such payment, provided that Mexico could pledge
to the United States its faith for the reimbursement of
the money, with six per cent interest, to be secured by
special lien upon all the public lands and mineral rights
in the several Mexican States of Lower California, Chihuahua,
Sonora, and Cinaloa, the property so pledged to
become absolute in the United States at the expiration
of the term of six years from the time when the treaty
went into effect, if such reimbursement were not made
before that time. The President felt that this course
was rendered necessary by circumstances as new as they
are eventful, and seeming to admit of no delay.</p>

<p>Mr. Seward proceeds to say, that his instructions are
conditional upon the consent of the British and French
Governments to forbear action against Mexico, on account
of failure or refusal to pay the interest in question,
until after the treaty had been submitted to the
Senate, and, if ratified, then so long thereafter as the
interest is paid by the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. Seward adds, that his instructions are not to be
considered as specific, but general, subject to modification
as to sums, terms, securities, and other points.</p>

<p>Mr. Corwin, in an earlier despatch, dated at Mexico,
29th July, 1861, and addressed to Mr. Seward, had already
suggested the policy he was now authorized to
pursue, and proposed a lien on the public lands and
mineral rights in the provinces mentioned by Mr. Seward.
From such arrangement, in his opinion, two consequences
would follow: first, all hope of extending the
domain of a separate Southern republic in this quarter
or in Central America would be extinguished; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
secondly, any further attempt to establish European
power on this continent would cease to occupy either
England or Continental Europe.</p>

<p>Afterwards, in a despatch, dated at Mexico, November
29, 1861, Mr. Corwin enclosed to Mr. Seward the
project of a treaty between the United States and Mexico,
by which the United States were to lend Mexico
five millions of dollars, payable in monthly instalments
of one half million a month,&mdash;also the further sum of
four millions of dollars, payable in sums of one half
million every six months; the whole to be secured by
mortgage on the public lands, mineral rights, and Church
property of Mexico, for the realization of which a board
of five commissioners was to be organized, three to be
appointed by Mexico and two by the United States,
holding sessions in the city of Mexico until the debt
and interest were fully discharged. No reference was
made in the proposed treaty to the consent of the British
and French Governments, mentioned by Mr. Seward
as a condition, nor to the application of the money,
when received by Mexico; nor does anything on this
subject appear in the accompanying despatch.</p>

<p>The President, by his Message of December 17, 1861,
submitted the draught of this treaty to the Senate for
their advice. Afterwards, by another Message, of January
24, 1862, he called their attention to it again, in
the following language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have heretofore submitted to the Senate a request for
its advice upon the question pending by treaty for making
a loan to Mexico, which Mr. Corwin thinks will in any case
be expedient. It seems to me to be my duty now to solicit
an early action of the Senate upon the subject, to the end
that I may cause such instructions to be given to Mr. Corwin
as will enable him to act in the manner which, while it
will most carefully guard the interests of our country, will
at the same time be most beneficial to Mexico.”</p>

</div>

<p>Meanwhile, Great Britain, France, and Spain, by a
Convention, dated at London, October 31, 1861, have
entered into an alliance, the declared object of which
is “to demand from the authorities of the Republic of
Mexico more efficacious protection for the persons and
properties of their subjects, as well as a fulfilment of the
obligations contracted by the Republic of Mexico.” The
high contracting parties engaged not to seek for themselves,
in the employment of coercive measures, any
acquisition of territory, nor any special advantage, and
not to exercise in the internal affairs of Mexico any influence
of a nature to prejudice the right of the Mexican
nation to choose and to constitute freely the form of its
government. Desiring that the measures they intend to
adopt should not bear an exclusive character, and being
aware that the Government of the United States, on its
part, has, like them, claims upon the Mexican Republic,
they further agree that our Government shall be invited
to join in the Convention.</p>

<p>Mr. Seward, in a despatch, dated at Washington, December
4, 1861, declined to join in the Convention, saying,
“that the United States prefer, as much as lies in
their power, to maintain the traditional policy recommended
by the Father of their country, confirmed by
successful experience, and which forbids them to make
an alliance with foreign powers.”</p>

<p>In pursuance of this Convention, the naval and military
forces of the three great powers have assembled at
San Juan de Ulua, and the flags of the three powers now
float over the castle. The Government of Mexico has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
rallied the people to resistance, and there is at this moment
the prospect of a prolonged and exhausting contest.
The occasion seems to have arrived, when the aid
proposed by Mr. Seward, in his despatch of September
2, 1861, may be of decisive value to Mexico. To the
United States it may also be of great importance, if it
could be the means of removing from Mexico the pressure
of hostile armaments, and placing a neighbor republic
in a more tranquil and independent condition. If
the Allied Powers desire security for their claims, and
nothing else, then a reasonable provision of this nature
ought to be satisfactory, so far as any question arises
from the claim.</p>

<p>The debt of Mexico to the Allied Powers may be
stated, in round numbers, as follows.</p>

<p>Of course, payment or guaranty of this large mass on
our part is out of the question; nor was it contemplated
by the United States in the original instructions to Mr.
Corwin. It was proposed to make such payment as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>

forbearance of the Allied Powers. To this end, Mr.
Seward offered to assume the interest of the Mexican
debt for the term of five years. But the unfunded
claims in the foregoing list, entitled “immediate,” it is
understood, are pressed with equal energy by the Allied
Powers. If these were satisfied, and provision made for

<p>The assumption of all these liabilities for a long
period would throw upon the United States a burden
too great for the present moment, although, perhaps,
not out of proportion to the anticipated advantages. If
anything be done on our part, it must be more moderate.
The offer of Mr. Seward for five years, if accepted,
would devolve upon the United States a responsibility
sufficiently large; and this responsibility ought to be
kept within a limitation, of which $15,000,000 should
be a maximum.</p>

<p>But there are two conditions to be required by the
United States, before the assumption of any such responsibility.
The first is the assent of the Allied
Powers, and the acceptance on their part of the friendly
offers proposed. Unless the Allied Powers are parties
to the transaction, it would be productive only of
embarrassment and loss, without accomplishing any permanent
good to the United States or to Mexico.</p>

<p>The other essential condition is, that security should
be given by Mexico for the liabilities assumed. It is
not too much to expect such security; nor is Mexico,
as is well known, disinclined to give it. Her creditors
are now foreclosing their demands, at the cost, perhaps,
of her national existence, and she turns to the United
States for help. Not merely friendship, but a continental
policy, affecting our own cherished interests,
prompts us to afford such help, so far as in our power.
In asking for security, we simply follow the rules of
prudence, whether between individuals or nations.</p>

<p>The security proposed by Mr. Corwin on the public
lands, minerals, and Church property of Mexico, would
require the appointment of a board or mixed commission
for the management and disposition of this
property. This necessity adds to the compl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>ications of
such security.</p>

<p>The security proposed by Mr. Seward, on the public
lands and mineral rights in the several provinces of
Lower California, Chihuahua, Sonora, and Cinaloa, is
simple, and it is understood that in some of this territory
there is vast mineral wealth. The province of
Lower California is unquestionably the territory of
Mexico most interesting to the United States in a
military and naval point of view.</p>

<p>Another security, perhaps less manageable, but more
interesting still, would be the right of way across the
Isthmus of Tehuantepec, with a mortgage on the adjoining
public lands of the Isthmus. Estimated by its
pecuniary value, this security would not be large; but
there can be no doubt of its political and commercial
value.</p>

<p>Still another security would be a pledge by Mexico
of 25 per cent, or perhaps a larger percentage, of the
customs or other revenues.</p>

<p>It is not easy to say positively, at this distance from
the scene of operations, and with the information before
the Committee, what is the most practicable form of
security. Perhaps it is advisable to leave the matter to
the careful discretion of our minister at Mexico, under
instructions from the President, with the explicit understanding
that the United States decline any territorial
acquisition, and seek the consolidation of Mexico, without
dismemberment of any kind.</p>

<p>Such are the main features of the question on which
the President has asked the advice of the Senate. With
more precise information on the matters involved, it
might be proper for the Senate to enter upon details
in its answer. But such information, especially with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
regard to actual relations, now daily changing, between
Mexico and the Allied Powers, can be obtained only on
the spot. It is evident, therefore, that the Senate can
do little more than indicate an opinion on what has
already been done, and declare the proper principles on
which a negotiation with Mexico should be conducted,
without presuming to fix in advance all its terms.
Much must be left to the discretion of our minister
there, and to the instructions he will receive from the
President.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Committee recommend the passage of the following
resolution.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Resolved</i>, That, in the changing condition of the relations
between Mexico and the Allied Powers, and in the
absence of precise information, it is impossible for the Senate
to advise the President with regard to all the terms of a
treaty with Mexico, so as to supersede the exercise of considerable
discretion on the part of our Minister there, under
instructions from the President, but that, in answer to the
two several Messages of the President, the Senate expresses
the following conclusions.</p>

<p><i>First.</i> The Senate approves the terms of the instructions
to our Minister at Mexico contained in the despatch bearing
date September 2, 1861.</p>

<p><i>Secondly.</i> The Senate does not advise a treaty in conformity
with the project communicated by our Minister to
Mexico in his despatch of November 29, 1861, as the same
fails to secure in any way the application of the money to
the demands of the Allied Powers, or either of them, and
therefore can be in no respect satisfactory to them.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly.</i> The Senate advises a treaty with Mexico providing
for the assumption of the interest on the debt from
Mexico to the Allied Powers during a limited period of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>time, and also for the payment of certain immediate claims
by these Powers, the whole liability to be kept within the
smallest possible sum; it being understood that the same
shall be accepted by the Allied Powers in present satisfaction
of their claims, so that they shall withdraw from
Mexico.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> And it shall be secured by such mortgage or
pledge as is most practicable, without any territorial acquisition
or dismemberment of Mexico.</p>

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The Resolution reported by the Committee was amended in the Senate
by striking out all after the word “<i>Resolved</i>,” and inserting in lieu
thereof as follows: “That, in reply to the two several Messages of the
President with regard to a treaty with Mexico, the Senate express the
opinion that it is not advisable to negotiate a treaty that will require
the United States to assume any portion of the principal or interest of
the debt of Mexico, or that will require the concurrence of European
powers.”</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Motion and Remarks in the Senate, February 25, 1862.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>February 25th, the Senate having under consideration a bill, reported
by Mr. Trumbull, of Illinois, to confiscate the property and free
the slaves of Rebels, an incidental question arose on the recognition of
the Fugitive Slave Bill, when Mr. Sumner spoke as follows.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I desire to move an amendment, which I believe
will carry out the idea of the Senator from Kansas.
I concur with that Senator in all he has said in relation
to the Fugitive Slave Bill. I have never called it a law,
hardly an act. I regard it simply as a bill, still a bill,
having no authority under the Constitution. There is
no unsoundness in that instrument out of which such
excrescence can grow. That is my idea; I believe it is
the idea of the Senator from Kansas. Therefore I concur
with him in any criticism upon legislation seeming
even in the most indirect way to recognize the existence
of a thing which can have, thank God, under the
Constitution, when properly interpreted, no legal existence.
Therefore, if the language introduced in this
bill has the effect which the Senator supposes, if it
does in any way recognize the existence of that bill,
certainly I am against it; and when I listened to the
remarks of the Senator, and critically examined the language,
I must say I feared that there was some implication
or other on our part in favor of that bill. I therefore
propose an amendment which shall remove all such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
implication or possibility of recognition on our part,
while, at the same time, I believe it will carry out
completely, adequately, in every respect, the idea of
the Senator from Illinois in the measure now under
consideration. The language here is as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And whenever any person claiming to be entitled to the
service or labor of any other person shall seek to enforce
such claim, he shall, in the first instance, and before <em>any
order for the surrender of the person whose service is claimed,
establish not only his title to such service, as now provided by
law, but also</em> that he is, and has been, during the existing
Rebellion, loyal to the Government of the United States.”</p>

</div>

<p>I propose to strike out all after the word “before,”
in the sixteenth line, down to the word “that,” in the
nineteenth line, being these words,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“any order for the surrender of the person whose service
is claimed, establish not only his title to such service, as now
provided by law, but also”&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">and instead thereof insert&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“proceeding with the trial of his claim, satisfactorily
prove”&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">so that the sentence will read,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“he shall, in the first instance, and before proceeding with
the trial of his claim, satisfactorily prove that he is, and has
been, during the existing Rebellion, loyal to the Government
of the United States.”</p>

</div>

<p>This language, as I believe, carries out completely the
idea of the Senator from Illinois in the measure before
us. I think it also carries out the idea of the Senator
from Kansas. It gives all proper efficacy to the language
of the statute; at the same time it does not compromise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
any of us, in this age of Christian light, by a new recognition,
direct or indirect, of the Fugitive Slave Bill.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Cowan.</span> How long will that provision last?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> As long as this statute lasts.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Cowan.</span> Then a person claiming one hundred years
from this time would open his cause by showing that he was
loyal during this Rebellion!</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I hope so, certainly,&mdash;forever.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The amendment was agreed to. The bill never became a law. Another
bill on the same subject from the House of Representatives was
adopted, with the following title, “To suppress Insurrection, to punish
Treason and Rebellion, to seize and confiscate the property of Rebels,
and for other purposes,” and approved by the President, July 17,
1862.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>This meeting was in pursuance of the following call.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All citizens of New York who rejoice in the downfall of treason, and
are in favor of sustaining the National Government in the most energetic
exercise of all the rights and powers of war, in the prosecution of its purpose
to destroy the cause of such treason, and to recover the territories
heretofore occupied by certain States recently overturned and wholly subverted
as members of the Federal Union by a hostile and traitorous power
calling itself ‘The Confederate States,’ and <em>all who concur in the conviction
that said traitorous power, instead of achieving the destruction of the Nation,
has thereby only destroyed Slavery</em>, and that it is now the sacred duty of the
National Government, as the only means of securing permanent peace, national
unity and well-being, to provide against its restoration, and <em>to establish
in said territories Democratic Institutions founded upon the principles of the
Great Declaration</em>, ‘That all <span class="smcap">Men</span> are created equal, endowed by their
Creator with the unalienable rights of Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness,’
are requested to meet at the Cooper Institute, on the sixth day of
March, at eight o’clock, <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>, to express to the President and Congress their
views as to the measures proper to be adopted in the existing emergency.”</p>

</div>

<p>On the day of this great meeting the President communicated to
Congress his Message on Compensated Emancipation, which was his
first public step in the transcendent cause.</p>

<p>The President of the meeting was Hon. James A. Hamilton, the
venerable son of Alexander Hamilton, who agreed with Mr. Sumner
in regard to the death of Slavery and the power of Congress. There
was also a distinguished list of Vice-Presidents, with George Bancroft
at the head. There were letters from Preston King, Senator of New
York, Henry Wilson, Senator of Massachusetts, David Wilmot, Senator
of Pennsylvania, George W. Julian, Representative in Congress from
Indiana, and from Mr. Sumner. Among the orators were the President
of the meeting, Mr. Martin F. Conway, Representative in Congress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>from Kansas, and Carl Schurz, who had recently returned from
his Spanish mission.</p>

<p>The report in the <i>New York Tribune</i> has the caption, “The Suicide
of Slavery.&mdash;New York for a Free Republic.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner’s letter was a vindication of his Resolutions.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Senate Chamber</span>, March 5, 1862.</p>

<p class="dropcap">DEAR SIR,&mdash;Never, except when suffering from
positive disability, have I allowed myself to be
absent from my seat in the Senate for a single day, and
now, amid the extraordinary duties of the present session,
I am more than ever bound by this inflexible rule.
If anything could tempt me to depart from it, I should
find apology in the invitation with which you honor
me.</p>

<p>The meeting called under such distinguished auspices
is needed at this moment as a rally to those
true principles by which alone this great Rebellion can
be permanently suppressed. I should be truly happy
to take part in it, and try to impart something of the
strength of my own convictions.</p>

<p>It is only necessary that people should see things as
they are, and they will easily see how to deal with
them. This is the obvious condition of practical action.
Now, beyond all question, Slavery is the great
original malefactor and omnipresent traitor,&mdash;more
deadly to the Union than all Rebel leaders, civil or
military. Therefore, as you are in earnest against the
Rebellion, you will not spare Slavery. And happily the
way is plain, so that it cannot be mistaken.</p>

<p>Look throughout the whole Rebel territory, and you
do not find a single officer legally qualified to discharge
any function of Government. By the Constitution
of the United States, “members of the several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial officers,
both of the United States and of the several States,
shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support this
Constitution.” But these functionaries have all renounced
allegiance to the United States, and taken a
new oath to support the Rebel Government, so that
at this moment they cannot be recognized as constitutionally
empowered to act. But a State is known only
through its functionaries, constitutionally empowered to
act; and since all these have ceased to exist, the State,
with its unnatural institutions, has ceased to exist also,
or it exists only in the lifeless parchments by which its
Government was originally established. The action of
these functionaries was impotent to transfer its territory
to a pretended confederation. To destroy the State was
all they could do.</p>

<p>In the absence of any legitimate authority in this
territory, Congress must assume the necessary jurisdiction.
Not to do so is abandonment of urgent duty.
Some propose a temporary military government; others
propose a temporary provisional government, with limited
powers. These all concede to Congress jurisdiction
over the territory; nor can such jurisdiction be justly
questioned. But I cannot doubt that it is better to
follow the authoritative precedents of our history, and
proceed as Congress is accustomed to proceed in the
organization and government of other territories. This
is simple.</p>

<p>And as to Slavery, if there be any doubt that it died
constitutionally and legally with the State from which
it drew its malignant breath, it might be prohibited by
the enactment of that same Jeffersonian ordinance which
originally established Freedom throughout the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
Northwest.</p>

<p>Accept my thanks for the honor you have done me,
and believe me, dear Sir,</p>

<p class="sig">Faithfully yours,</p>

<p class="sig2"><span class="smcap">Charles Sumner</span>.</p>

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>Among the resolutions adopted at the meeting was one calling for
the overthrow of Slavery,&mdash;“because the supreme jurisdiction of the
National Constitution over all the territories now occupied by the
Rebel States must be held to be exclusive of the traitorous Rebel authorities
therein established, by virtue of which alone Slavery now
therein exists, and that wherever the Constitution has exclusive jurisdiction
it ordains Liberty and not Slavery.”</p>

<p>These were forwarded to Mr. Sumner by one of the secretaries, with
the following letter.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I hand herewith a copy of Resolutions adopted, amid the wildest enthusiasm,
and without a breath of dissent, by an assembly of some three thousand
of our prominent citizens, last evening, at the Cooper Institute Mass
Meeting. No such audience has been convened in this city (except only
the Union Square meeting of last April) since your address in July, 1860.
Nor has so demonstrative a gathering been seen here since that time. I say
this to give you an idea of the character and popularity of the affair. I
hand the Resolutions to you <em>for personal presentation to the President</em> (and
to <em>Congress</em>, if your views are not opposed to such a course), preferring to
secure their reaching the President through you as a medium of communication.”</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>March 27th, the bill was reported to the Senate by Mr. Collamer, of
Vermont, Chairman of the Committee, without amendment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The existing law was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That no other than a free white person shall be employed in conveying
the mail, and any contractor who shall employ or permit any other than a
free white person to convey the mail shall for every such offence incur
a penalty of twenty dollars.”<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This passed the Senate March 1, 1825, and the House March 2, without
a division. The first suggestion of this measure was as early as
1802, by Gideon Granger, Postmaster-General, in a communication
addressed to Hon. James Jackson, Senator from Georgia, which, it will
be seen, was private in character.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium">“<span class="smcap">General Post-Office</span>, March 23, 1802.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;An objection exists against employing negroes, or people of color,
in transporting the public mails, of a nature too delicate to ingraft into a report
which may become public, yet too important to be omitted or passed
over without full consideration. I therefore take the liberty of making to
the Committee, through you, a private representation on that subject.…</p>

<p>“Everything which tends to increase their knowledge of natural rights, of
men and things, or that affords them an opportunity of associating, acquiring,
and communicating sentiments, and of establishing a chain or line of
intelligence, must increase your hazard, because it increases their means of
effecting their object.</p>

<p>“The most active and intelligent are employed as post-riders. These are
the most ready to learn and the most able to execute. By travelling from
day to day, and hourly mixing with people, they must, they will, acquire
information. <em>They will learn that a man’s rights do not depend on his color.
They will in time become teachers to their brethren.</em> They become acquainted
with each other on the line. Whenever the body, or a portion of
them, wish to act, they are an organized corps, circulating our intelligence
openly, their own privately.”<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This communication, which Mr. Sumner laid before the Committee,
was the argument on which he relied.</p>

<p>April 11th, the bill was considered in the Senate, on motion of
Mr. Sumner, and passed without amendment or debate: Yeas 24,
Nays 11.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A correspondent of the <i>Boston Journal</i> remarked at the time:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This is the first time, within the recollection of your correspondent, that
any bill having the negro in it, directly or indirectly, has been passed by the
Senate without debate. What a good time is coming, when the negro questions
shall all have been legislated upon, and when the African race will no
longer be a bone of contention in our legislative halls!”</p>

</div>

<p>The bill was less fortunate in the House of Representatives, where,
May 20th, Mr. Colfax, of Indiana, reported it from the Post-Office Committee
with the recommendation that it do not pass. In explaining
the reasons for this report, he referred to the original Act of Congress
establishing the disqualification, and said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That law has been on the statute-book for more than a third of a century.
Among all the petitions presented during that time to this House and
the Senate, from people in all sections of the country, there has not been, so
far as I have been able to discover, a single petition from any person, white
or black, male or female, asking for a repeal or modification of this law. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>has remained there by common consent until the present time; and therefore
I think it unwise and inexpedient to pass the bill at the present time, not
being demanded by public opinion.</p>

<p>“In the second place, the repeal of this bill does not affect exclusively the
blacks of the country, as generally supposed. It will throw open the business
of mail-contracting, and of thus becoming officers of the Post-Office
Department, not only to blacks, but also to the Indian tribes, civilized and
uncivilized, and to the Chinese, who have come in such large numbers to
the Pacific coast.…</p>

<p>“By this bill, if it is to pass, you would allow all over the South the employment
by the slaveholder of his slaves to carry the mail, and to receive
compensation for the labor of such slaves out of the Federal Treasury. By
the present law not a dollar is ever paid out of the Post-Office Treasury to
any slaveholder for the labor of his slave.…</p>

<p>“Mr. Speaker, I am furthermore authorized by the Postmaster-General to
say that he has not recommended the passage of this bill, nor does he regard
it as promotive of the interests of the Department. I cannot find that it is
asked for by any official or private citizen throughout the length and breadth
of this land.”</p>

</div>

<p>To these objections he added, that it was necessary to have testimony
by which you can convict mail depredators; and “in some of the States
Indians and negroes, and in California and Oregon the Chinese also, are
not allowed by the statutes of the State to give testimony in the courts
against white persons.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dawes, of Massachusetts, inquired of Mr. Colfax, “whether he
supposes depredators upon the mails are tried in the State courts, or
whether they are tried in the United States courts, and if the latter,
whether he and I do not make the laws of the United States and the
courts of the United States, prescribing who shall testify and who shall
not?”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. Colfax.</span> Not being a lawyer, and not understanding, therefore,
all the rules which govern the proceedings of the courts, I, however, say
that I am informed by those who are lawyers that the rules of evidence in
force in the States respectively are adopted by the United States courts in
such States. And the gentleman from Massachusetts, who is a lawyer,
ought to have known the fact, and, knowing it, ought not to have asked
me such a question.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. Dawes.</span> The gentleman from Indiana has not quite answered me.”<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Colfax moved to lay the bill on the table, which was ordered,
May 21st: Yeas 82, Nays 45. So the bill was lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>In the next Congress it was again introduced by Mr. Sumner.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A letter from William C. Nell, of Boston, well known for his volume
on “The Colored Patriots of the Revolution,” shows how a single individual
suffered under this discrimination of color.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Please accept my sincere thanks for your efforts to remove the disqualification
of color in mail-carrying.</p>

<p>“Mr. Phillips conveyed to me the substance of information imparted by
you, to wit, the postponement of the bill in the House. To me the disappointment
is heavy, presuming said action to be a finality, at least for this
session, and the next one is not likely to be as liberal.</p>

<p>“I never had more desire or more need of chances to earn money than
now, and never were my opportunities so small.”</p>

</div>

<p>The existing law was general, and Mr. Nell could not be a letter-carrier
in Boston.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p>In activity against Slavery Mr. Sumner did not confine himself to
public effort. By writing and personal appeal he was always doing.
The letter to Governor Andrew, already given,<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> not only shows his exertion
in that important quarter, but affords a glimpse of his relations
with the President, whom he reports as saying that there was a
difference between them of a month or six weeks only. In point of
fact, Mr. Sumner found the difference much greater.</p>

<p>On his arrival at Washington, previously to the opening of Congress,
he lost no time in seeing the President, who read to him the draught of
his Annual Message. Mr. Sumner was disheartened by the absence of
any recommendation or statement on Emancipation, and especially by
what the President told him of his striking from Mr. Cameron’s Report
a strong passage on this subject. But he was entirely satisfied that the
President was really against Slavery, and was determined to do his
duty. From that time Mr. Sumner saw him constantly, never missing
an opportunity of pressing action. Not a week passed without one
or more interviews. At the same time, Mr. Chase was pressing, also,
and the two interchanged reports with regard to his state of mind.
During this time he was watching the Border States, and communicating
with friends in Kentucky. For Mr. Sumner this was an anxious
period.</p>

<p>At last, early in the morning of March 6th, he received a request from
the President to come to him as soon as convenient after breakfast.
Mr. Sumner hastened, and on his arrival the President said that he
had something to read; and he then read the draught of the Special
Message of that date, proposing Compensated Emancipation.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner never had strong faith in the practicability of Compensated
Emancipation on a large scale, and was always against Gradual
Emancipation; but he welcomed any step towards Emancipation, being
assured, that, when once begun in any way, it must proceed to the complete
establishment of Freedom. In the conversation that ensued he
began with a mild protest against gradualism in dealing with wrong,
but said nothing against compensation. Taking the draught into his
hands, and reading it over slowly and carefully, he could not but object
to a certain brief paragraph, which he thought might be turned
against us by the other side, and he asked permission to rewrite it, so
as to remove the ground of possible objection. While occupied in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
attempt with his pencil, the President said: “Don’t trouble yourself;
I will strike it all out”: and it was struck out. As Mr. Sumner continued
for some time studying the paper, the President at length interrupted
him in a familiar, pleasant way, saying: “Enough; you must
go, or the boys<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> won’t have time to copy it.” He then said that he
should communicate the Message to the Senate that day. It was communicated
accordingly.</p>

<p>Before he left, Mr. Sumner told the President, that, though knowing
that the Message was coming, he should stand aside and leave to others
the making of the proper motion with regard to it. As he anticipated,
nothing was ever done under it beyond the adoption by the two Houses
of the joint resolution recommended: “That the United States ought
to coöperate with any State which may adopt <em>gradual</em> abolishment of
Slavery, giving to such State pecuniary aid, to be used by such State in
its discretion, to compensate for the inconveniences, public and private,
produced by such change of system.” But the Message gave public assurance
that the President was occupied with the great question, and
its concluding words sank into the popular heart. “In full view,” he
said, “of my great responsibility to my God and to my country, I earnestly
beg the attention of Congress and the people to the subject.”
Many breathed freer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile a bill was introduced into the Senate by Mr. Wilson,
providing for Emancipation in the District of Columbia. This was entitled,
“For the release of certain persons held to service or labor in the
District of Columbia.” It provided for a commission to appraise the
claims on account of the slaves liberated, limiting their allowance in
the aggregate to an amount equal to three hundred dollars a slave, and
appropriated one million dollars to pay loyal owners; to which was
added, on motion of Mr. Doolittle, one hundred thousand dollars for
the colonization of slaves who desired to emigrate to Hayti or Liberia.</p>

<p>This bill was introduced December 16th, referred to the Committee
on the District of Columbia December 20th, reported with amendments
by Mr. Morrill of Maine February 13th, taken up for consideration
March 12th, and proceeded with to its final passage April 3d: Yeas
29, Nays 14.</p>

<p>April 11th, it passed the House: Yeas 94, Nays 44.</p>

<p>April 16th, it was approved by the President, who sent a Message
expressing gratification that “the two principles of compensation and
colonization are both recognized and practically applied in the Act.”<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>In the interval between the passage of the bill and its approval by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>the President there was concern with many lest it should fail in his
hands. During this painful suspense, Mr. Sumner visited the President,
and said: “Do you know who at this moment is the largest
slave-<em>holder</em> in this country? It is Abraham Lincoln; for he holds all
the three thousand slaves of the District, which is more than any other
person in the country holds.” He then expressed astonishment that
the President could postpone the approval a single night.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Sumner spoke, March 31st, treating the case as of ransom rather
than compensation. He was willing to vote money for Emancipation,
but would not recognize the title of the master implied in compensation.
The distinction facilitated a bolder dealing with the question,
which was needed in the Rebel States.</p>

<p>This method was noticed especially by the <i>New York Tribune</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The speech of Mr. Sumner in the Senate on the Bill for the Abolition of
Slavery in the District of Columbia is a statesmanlike view of the subject,
which should commend it to the impartial consideration of the country. He
addressed himself, not to a discussion of the character of Slavery itself, but
simply to its recognition in the national capital, and advocates its removal
because it is not in accordance with the Constitution. On this point his
reasoning is conclusive, and is an appeal to the national self-respect which
ought not to be disregarded. Not less forcible is the ground he takes on the
question of compensation. Viewing it rather in the light of ransom for the
slave than compensation to the master for a right surrendered, he upholds
it as a duty springing from the complicity of the whole country in the existence
heretofore of the system in the domain exclusively under national jurisdiction.
Common sense and a sense of justice to all parties alike commend
such a treatment of the subject.”</p>

</div>

<p>Lewis Tappan, the early and most watchful Abolitionist, wrote from
New York:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have just read the speech again in pamphlet form. Your able efforts
in procuring the passage of this bill add another link to the golden chain by
which you are bound to the good people of my native State, and, as I believe,
to posterity.”</p>

</div>

<p>Orestes A. Brownson, able and indefatigable with his pen, recognized
the idea of ransom.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I thank you for your able speech on the Ransom of the Slaves in the
District of Columbia. The term <em>Ransom</em> is happily chosen, and meets many
scruples.”</p>

</div>

<p>Frederick Douglass wrote with the effusion of a freeman once a
slave.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I want only a moment of your time to give you my thanks for your
great speech in the Senate on the Bill for the Abolition of Slavery in the
District of Columbia. I trust I am not dreaming; but the events taking
place seem like a dream. If Slavery is really dead in the District of Columbia,
and merely waiting for the ceremony of ‘Dust to dust’ by the President,
to you more than to any other American statesman belongs the honor
of this great triumph of justice, liberty, and sound policy. I rejoice for my
freed brothers,&mdash;and, Sir, I rejoice for you. You have lived to strike down
in Washington the power that lifted the bludgeon against your own free
voice. I take nothing from the good and brave men who have coöperated
with you. There is, or ought to be, a head to every body; and whether you
will or not, the slaveholder and the slave look to you as the best embodiment
of the Antislavery idea now in the councils of the nation. May God sustain
you!”</p>

</div>

<p>The speech, while addressed to the particular circumstances of the
District of Columbia, presented considerations applicable to Slavery
everywhere. It was a blow at Slavery outside the District, as well as
inside, while it illustrated the power and duty of Congress over this
subject.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>Before Mr. Sumner began, Mr. Davis, of Kentucky, read the following
interrogatories.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It may be that the speech which the honorable Senator intends to pronounce
may cover the points which I have embodied in some questions to
him. If not, I should take it very kindly, if the honorable Senator will answer
the questions. I will read them.</p>

<p>“1. Are slaves in the District of Columbia, and in the slaveholding
States, legally the subject of property?</p>

<p>“2. Has Congress the power to deprive the owners of lands and houses
and lots situated in the District of Columbia of that property?</p>

<p>“3. What law or laws give the owners of real estate in the District of
Columbia their right to such property? Inform us where such law or laws
may be found and read.</p>

<p>“4. What law or laws give a different right and title to slaves and to
real estate? Where can such law or laws be found?</p>

<p>“5. Is or not the Constitution, and the laws of the United States made
in pursuance thereof, and all the treaties made under the authority of the
United States, the supreme law of the land, which all persons, without any
exception whatever, are bound to obey?</p>

<p>“6. Is or not the Supreme Court of the United States the proper and
final tribunal to judge and determine all questions, whether in law or equity,
under the Constitution and laws of the United States?”</p>

</div>

<p>The answers to these interrogatories, so far as they bear on the main
question, will be found in the course of the speech.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;With unspeakable delight I
hail this measure and the prospect of its speedy
adoption. Though only a small instalment of that great
debt to an enslaved race which we all owe, yet will it
be recognized in history as a victory of humanity. At
home, throughout our own country, it will be welcomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
with gratitude, while abroad it will quicken the hopes
of all who love Freedom. Liberal institutions will gain
everywhere by the abolition of Slavery at the national
capital. Nobody can read that slaves were once sold
in the markets of Rome, beneath the eyes of the Sovereign
Pontiff, without confessing the scandal to religion,
even in a barbarous age; and nobody can hear that
slaves are now sold in the markets of Washington, beneath
the eyes of the President, without confessing the
scandal to liberal institutions. For the sake of the
national name, if not for the sake of justice, let the
scandal cease.</p>

<p>In early discussions of this question many topics
were introduced that obtain little attention now. It
was part of the tactics of Slavery to claim absolute
immunity. Indeed, without such immunity it had
small chance to exist. Such a wrong, so utterly outrageous,
could find safety only where protected from
inquiry. Therefore Slave-Masters always insisted that
petitions against its maintenance at the national capital
were not to be received, that it was unconstitutional
to touch it even here within the exclusive jurisdiction
of Congress, and that, if it were touched, it should be
only under the auspices of the neighboring States of
Virginia and Maryland. On these points elaborate
arguments were constructed, useless to consider now.
Whatever the opinions of individual Senators, the
judgment of the country is fixed. The right of petition,
first vindicated by the matchless perseverance of
John Quincy Adams, is now beyond question, and the
constitutional power of Congress is hardly less free
from doubt. It is enough to say on this point, that, if
Congress cannot abolish Slavery here, then there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
power anywhere to abolish it here, and this wrong will
endure always, lasting as the capital itself.</p>

<p>As the moment of justice approaches, we are called
to meet a different objection, inspired by generous sentiments.
It is urged, that, since there can be no such
thing as property in man, especially within the exclusive
jurisdiction of Congress, therefore all held as slaves
at the national capital are justly entitled to freedom
without price or compensation of any kind,&mdash;or, at
least, that any money paid should be distributed according
to an account stated between master and slave.
If this question were determined according to divine
justice, so far as we may be permitted to contemplate
such a judgment, it is obvious that nothing can be due
to the master, and that any money paid belongs rather
to the slave, who for generations has been despoiled of
every right and possession. If we undertake to audit
this fearful account, pray what sum shall be allowed
for the prolonged torments of the lash? what treasure
shall be voted to the slave for wife ravished from his
side, for children stolen, for knowledge shut out, and
for all the fruits of labor wrested from him and his
fathers? No such account can be stated. It is impossible.
Once begin the inquiry, and all must go to the
slave. It only remains for Congress, anxious to secure
this great boon, and unwilling to embarrass or jeopard
it, to act practically, according to its finite powers, in
the light of existing usage, and even existing prejudice,
under which these odious relations have assumed
the form of law; nor can we hesitate at any forbearance
or sacrifice, provided Freedom is established without
delay.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>
<p>Testimony and eloquence have been accumulated
against Slavery; but on this occasion I shall confine
myself precisely to the argument for the ransom of
slaves at the National Capital; although such is Slavery
that it is impossible to consider it in any single
aspect without confronting its whole many-sided wickedness,
while the broad, diversified field of remedy is
naturally open to review. At some other time the
great question of emancipation in the States may be
more fitly considered, together with those other questions
where the Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. <span class="smcap">Doolittle</span>]
has allowed himself to take sides so earnestly,&mdash;whether
there is an essential incompatibility between
the two races, so that they cannot live together except
as master and slave? and whether the freedmen shall be
encouraged to exile themselves to other lands, or rather
continue their labor here at home? Enough for the present
to consider Slavery at the National Capital. And
here we are met by two inquiries, so frankly addressed
to the Senate by the clear-headed Senator from Kansas
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Pomeroy</span>]: first, <em>Has Slavery any constitutional existence
at the national capital?</em> and, secondly, <em>Shall money
be paid to secure its abolition?</em> The answer to these
two inquiries will make our duty clear. If Slavery has
no constitutional existence here, then more than ever
is Congress bound to interfere, even with money; for
the scandal must be peremptorily stopped, without any
postponement, or any consultation of the people on a
point which is not within their power.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It may be said, that, whether Slavery be constitutional
or not, nevertheless it exists, and therefore
this inquiry is superfluous. True, it exists as a <span class="smcap">monstrous fact</span>;
but it is none the less important to consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
its origin, that we may understand how, assuming
the form of law, it was able to shelter itself beneath
the protecting shield of the Constitution. When we see
clearly that it is without any such just protection, that
the law which declares it is baseless, and that in all
its pretensions it is essentially and utterly brutal and
unnatural, we shall have less consideration for the
Slave Tyranny, which, in satisfied pride, has thus far&mdash;not
without compunction at different moments&mdash;ruled
the national capital, reducing all things here, public
opinion, social life, and even the administration of justice,
to its own degraded standard, so as to fulfil the
curious words of an old English poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent11">“It serves, yet reigns as King;</div>
<div class="verse">It lives, yet ’s death; it pleases, full of paine.</div>
<div class="verse">Monster! ah, who, who can thy beeing faigne,</div>
<div class="verse">Thou shapelesse shape, live death, paine pleasing, servile raigne?”<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is true, there can be no such thing as property in
man: and here I begin to answer the questions propounded
by the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>].
If this pretension is recognized anywhere, it is only
another instance of custom, which is so powerful as to
render the idolater insensible to the wickedness of idolatry,
and the cannibal insensible to the brutality of cannibalism.
To argue against such a pretension seems to
be vain; for the pretension exists in open defiance of
reason as well as of humanity. It will not yield to
argument; nor will it yield to persuasion. It must be
encountered by authority. It was not the planters in
the British islands or in the French islands who organized
emancipation, but the distant governments across
the sea, far removed from local prejudice, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> at last
forbade the outrage. Had these planters been left to
themselves, they would have clung to the pretension, as
men among us still cling to it. In making this declaration
against the idea of property in man, I say nothing
new. An honored predecessor of the Senator from
Maryland [Mr. <span class="smcap">Kennedy</span>], whose fame as a statesman
was eclipsed, perhaps, by his more remarkable fame
as a lawyer,&mdash;I mean William Pinkney, and it is
among the recollections of my youth that I heard Chief
Justice Marshall call him the undoubted head of the
American bar,&mdash;in a speech before the Maryland House
of Delegates, spoke as statesman and lawyer, when he
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Sir, by the eternal principles of natural justice no master
in the State has a right to hold his slave in bondage for
a single hour.”<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And Henry Brougham spoke not only as statesman and
lawyer, but as orator also, when, in the British Parliament,
he uttered these memorable words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Tell me not of rights, talk not of the property of the
planter in his slaves. I deny the right, I acknowledge
not the property. The principles, the feelings, of our common
nature rise in rebellion against it. Be the appeal
made to the understanding or to the heart, the sentence is
the same that rejects it. In vain you tell me of laws that
sanction such a claim. There is a law above all the enactments
of human codes,&mdash;the same throughout the world,
the same in all times: … it is the law written on the
heart of man by the finger of his Maker; and by that law,
unchangeable and eternal, while men despise fraud and loathe
rapine and abhor blood, they will reject with indignation the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>wild and guilty fantasy that man can hold property in man.”<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It has been sometimes said that the finest sentence
of the English language is that famous description of
Law with which Hooker closes the first book of his
“Ecclesiastical Polity”; but I cannot doubt that this
wonderful denunciation of an irrational and inhuman
pretension will be remembered hereafter with higher
praise; for it gathers into surpassing eloquence the
waking and immitigable instincts of Universal Man.</p>

<p>If I enter now into analysis of Slavery, and say
familiar things, it is because such exposition is an
essential link in the present inquiry. Looking carefully
at Slavery as it is, we find that it is not merely
a single gross pretension, utterly inadmissible, but an
aggregation of gross pretensions, all and each utterly
inadmissible. They are five in number: first, the pretension
of property in man; secondly, the denial of the
marriage relation,&mdash;for slaves are “coupled” only, and
not married; thirdly, the denial of the paternal relation;
fourthly, the denial of instruction; and, fifthly,
the appropriation of all the labor of the slave and its
fruits by the master. Such are the five essential elements
which we find in Slavery; and this fivefold barbarism,
so utterly indefensible in every point, is maintained
for the single purpose of compelling labor without
wages. Of course such a pretension is founded in
force, and nothing else. It begins with the kidnapper
in Guinea or Congo, traverses the sea with the pirate
slave-trader in his crowded hold, and is continued
here by virtue of laws representing and embodying
the same brutal force that prevailed in the kidnapper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
and the pirate slave-trader. Slavery, wherever it exists,
is the triumph of force, sometimes in the strong
arm of an individual, and sometimes in the strong arm
of law, but in principle always the same. Depending
upon force, he is master who happens to be stronger,&mdash;so
that, if the slave were stronger, he would be
master, and the master would be slave. Beyond all
doubt, according to reason and justice, every slave possesses
the same right to enslave his master that his
master possesses to enslave him. If this simple statement
of unquestionable principles needed confirmation,
it would be found in the solemn judgments of courts.
Here, for instance, are the often quoted words of Mr.
Justice McLean, of the Supreme Court of the United
States: “Slavery is admitted by almost all who have
examined the subject to be founded in wrong, in oppression,
in <em>power</em> against <em>right</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> And here are the words
of the Supreme Court of North Carolina: “Such services
[of a slave] can only be expected from one who
has no will of his own, who surrenders his will in implicit
obedience to that of another. Such obedience is
the consequence only of <em>uncontrolled authority over the
body</em>. There is nothing else which can operate to produce
the effect.”<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> And the Supreme Court of the United
States, by the lips of Chief Justice Marshall, has openly
declared, in a famous case, read the other day by the
Senator from Kentucky [Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>], that “Slavery has
its origin in <em>force</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Thus does it appear by most
authoritative words, that this monstrous Barbarism is
derived not from reason, or nature, or justice, or goodness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
but from <em>force</em>, and nothing else.</p>

<p>Here in the national capital, under the exclusive jurisdiction
of Congress, the <span class="smcap">force</span> which now maintains
this unnatural system is supplied by Congress. Without
Congress the “uncontrolled authority” of the master
would cease. Without Congress the master would
not be master, nor would the slave be slave. Congress,
then, in existing legislation, is the power behind, which
enslaves our fellow-men. Therefore does it behoove
Congress, by proper, instant action, to relieve itself of
this painful responsibility.</p>

<p>The responsibility becomes more painful, when it is
considered that Slavery exists at the national capital
absolutely without support of any kind in the Constitution:
and here again I answer the Senator from Kentucky
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>]. Nor is this all. Situated within the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Constitution, where State
rights cannot prevail, it exists in open defiance of most
cherished principles. Let the Constitution be rightly interpreted
by a just tribunal, and Slavery must cease here
at once. The decision of a court would be as potent as
an Act of Congress. And now, as I confidently assert
this conclusion, which bears so directly on the present
question, pardon me, if I express the satisfaction with
which I recur to an earlier period, shortly after I entered
the Senate, when, vindicating the principle now
accepted, but then disowned, that <em>Freedom and not
Slavery is National</em>, I insisted upon its application to
Slavery everywhere within the exclusive jurisdiction
of the Constitution, and declared that Congress might
as well undertake to make a king as to make a slave.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
That argument has never been answered; it cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
answered. Nor can I forget that this same conclusion,
having such important bearings, was maintained
by Mr. Chase, while a member of this body, in that
masterly effort where he unfolded the relations of the
National Government to Slavery,<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> and also by the
late Horace Mann, in a most eloquent and exhaustive
speech in the other House, where no point is left untouched
to show that Slavery in the national capital is
an <em>outlaw</em>.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Among all the speeches in the protracted
discussion of Slavery, I know none more worthy of profound
study than those two, so different in character
and yet so harmonious in result. If authority could
add to irresistible argument, it would be found in the
well-known opinion of the late Mr. Justice McLean, in
a published letter, declaring the constitutional impossibility
of Slavery in the National Territories, because, in
the absence of express power under the Constitution
to establish or recognize Slavery, there was nothing
for the breath of Slavery, as respiration could not exist
where there was no atmosphere. The learned judge
was right, and his illustration was felicitous. Although
applied at the time only to the Territories, it is of equal
force everywhere within the exclusive jurisdiction of
Congress; for within such jurisdiction there is no atmosphere
in which Slavery can live.</p>

<p>If this question were less important, I should not
occupy time with its discussion. But we may learn to
detest Slavery still more, when we see how completely
it instals itself here in utter disregard of the Constitution,
compelling Congress ignobly to do its bidding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
The bare existence of such a barbarous injustice in the
metropolis of a Republic gloriously declaring that “all
men are entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,”
is a mockery which may excite surprise; but
when we bring it to the touchstone of the Constitution,
and consider the action of Congress, surprise is deepened
into indignation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>How, Sir, was this foothold secured? When and by
what process did the National Government, solemnly
pledged to Freedom, undertake to maintain the Slave-Master
here in the exercise of that <em>force</em>, or “unrestrained
power” which swings the lash, fastens the chain, robs
the wages, sells the child, and tears the wife from the
husband? A brief inquiry will show historically how
it occurred: and here again I answer the Senator from
Kentucky.</p>

<p>The sessions of the Revolutionary Congress were held,
according to the exigencies of war or the convenience of
members, at Philadelphia, Baltimore, Lancaster, York,
Princeton, Annapolis, Trenton, and New York. An insult
at Philadelphia from a band of mutineers caused an
adjournment to Princeton, in 1783, which was followed
by the discussion, from time to time, of the question of
a permanent seat of government. On the 7th of October,
1783, a motion was made by Mr. Gerry, of Massachusetts,
“That buildings for the use of Congress be
erected on the banks of the Delaware, near Trenton, or
of the Potomac, near Georgetown, provided a suitable
district can be procured on one of the rivers as aforesaid
for a federal town, and that the right of soil, and an exclusive
or such other jurisdiction as Congress may direct,
shall be vested in the United States.”<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> Thus <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>did the
first proposition of a national capital within the exclusive
jurisdiction of Congress proceed from a representative
of Massachusetts. The subject of Slavery at that time
attracted little attention; but at a later day, in the
Constitutional Convention, this same honored representative
showed the nature of the jurisdiction which he
would claim, according to the following record: “Mr.
Gerry thought we had nothing to do with the conduct
of the States as to slaves, <em>but ought to be careful not
to give any sanction to it</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> In these words will be found
our own cherished principle, <em>Freedom National, Slavery
Sectional</em>, expressed with homely and sententious simplicity.
There is something grateful and most suggestive
in the language employed, “we ought to be careful
not to give any sanction to it.” In the first Congress
under the Constitution, the same representative,
during the debate on the Slave-Trade, gave further expression
to this same conviction, when he said that “he
highly commended the part the Society of Friends had
taken; it was the cause of humanity they had interested
themselves in.”<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>The proposition of Mr. Gerry in reference to a national
capital, after assuming various forms, subsided.
But in 1785 three commissioners were appointed “to
lay out a district of not less than two nor exceeding
three miles square, on the banks of either side of the
Delaware, not more than eight miles above or below
the lower falls thereof, for a federal town.”<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> At the
Congress which met at New York two years later,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
unsuccessful efforts were made to substitute the Potomac
for the Delaware. The commissioners, though appointed,
never entered upon their business. At last,
by the adoption of the Constitution, the subject was
presented in a new form, under the following clause:
“The Congress shall have power to exercise exclusive
legislation, in all cases whatsoever, over such district,
not exceeding ten miles square, as may, by cession of
particular States, and the acceptance of Congress, become
the seat of government of the United States.”
From the records of the Convention it does not appear
that this clause occasioned debate. But it broke out in
the earliest Congress. Virginia and Maryland, each, by
acts of their respective Legislatures, tendered the ten
miles square, while similar propositions were made by
citizens of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. After long
and animated discussion, Germantown, in Pennsylvania,
was on the point of being adopted, when the subject was
postponed till the next session. Havre de Grace and
Wright’s Ferry, both on the Susquehanna, Baltimore, on
the Patapsco, and Connogocheague, on the Potomac, divided
opinions. In the course of the debate, Mr. Gerry,
who had first proposed the Potomac, now opposed it.
He pronounced it highly unreasonable to fix the seat
of government where nine States out of the thirteen
would be to the northward, and adverted to the sacrifice
the Northern States were ready to make in going as
far south as Baltimore. An agreement seemed impossible,
when the South suddenly achieved one of those
political triumphs by which its predominance in the
National Government was established.</p>

<p>Pending at this time was the great and trying proposition
to assume the State debts, which, being at first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
defeated through Southern votes, was at last carried by
a “compromise,” according to which the seat of government
was placed on the Potomac, thus settling the
much vexed question. Mr. Jefferson, in a familiar account,
thus sketches the “compromise.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It was observed that this pill [the assumption of the
State debts] would be peculiarly bitter to the Southern States,
<em>and that some concomitant measure should be adopted to sweeten
it a little to them</em>. There had before been propositions to
fix the seat of government either at Philadelphia or at
Georgetown on the Potomac, and it was thought that by
giving it to Philadelphia for ten years, and to Georgetown
permanently afterwards, this might, as an anodyne, calm in
some degree the ferment which might be excited by the other
measure alone. So two of the Potomac members (White
and Lee, but White with a revulsion of stomach almost convulsive)
agreed to change their votes, and Hamilton undertook
to carry the other point.”<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such was one of the earliest victories of Slavery in
the name of “Compromise.” It is difficult to estimate
the evil consequences thus entailed upon the country.</p>

<p>The bill establishing the seat of government, having
already passed the Senate, was adopted by the House of
Representatives, after vehement debate and many calls
of the yeas and nays, by a vote of thirty-two to twenty-nine,
on the 9th of July, 1790. A district of territory,
not exceeding ten miles square, on the river Potomac,
was accepted for the permanent seat of the Government
of the United States: “<i>Provided, nevertheless</i>, that the
operation of the laws of the State within such district
shall not be affected by this acceptance, until the time
fixed for the removal of the Government thereto, <em>and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
until Congress shall otherwise by law provide</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Here, it
will be seen, was a positive saving of the laws of the
States for a limited period, so far as Congress had power
to save them, within the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Constitution; but there was also complete recognition
of the power of Congress to change these laws, and an
implied promise to assume the “exclusive legislation in
all cases whatsoever” contemplated by the Constitution.</p>

<p>In response to this Act of Congress, Maryland, by formal
act, ceded the territory now constituting the District
of Columbia “in full and absolute right, and exclusive
jurisdiction, as well of soil as of persons residing or to
reside thereon,”&mdash;provided that the jurisdiction of Maryland
“shall not cease or determine, <em>until Congress shall
by law provide for the government thereof</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>In pursuance of this contract between the United
States of the one part and Maryland of the other part,
expressed in solemn statutes, the present seat of government
was occupied in November, 1800, when Congress
proceeded to assume that complete jurisdiction conferred
in the Constitution, by enacting, on the 27th of February,
1801, “that the laws of the State of Maryland, <em>as they
now exist</em>, shall be and continue in force in that part of
the said District which was ceded by that State to the
United States, and by them accepted for the permanent
seat of government.”<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Thus at one stroke all existing
laws of Maryland were adopted by Congress in gross,
and from that time forward became the laws of the
United States at the national capital. Although known
historically as laws of Maryland, they ceased at once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> to
be laws of that State, for they draw their vitality from
Congress alone, under the Constitution of the United
States, as completely as if every statute had been solemnly
reënacted. And now we see precisely how Slavery
obtained its foothold.</p>

<p>Among the statutes of Maryland thus solemnly reënacted
in gross was the following, originally passed
as early as 1715, in colonial days.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All negroes and other slaves already imported or hereafter
to be imported into this province, and all children now
born or hereafter to be born of such negroes and slaves,
shall be slaves during their natural lives.”<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Slavery cannot exist without barbarous laws in its
support. Maryland, accordingly, in the spirit of Slavery,
added other provisions, also reënacted by Congress
in the same general bundle, of which the following
is an example.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<em>No negro or mulatto slave</em>, free negro or mulatto born
of a white woman, during his time of servitude by law,
… <em>shall be admitted and received as good and valid
evidence in law, in any matter</em> or thing whatsoever depending
before any court of record or before any magistrate
within this province, <em>wherein any Christian white person is
concerned</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At a later day the following kindred provision was
added, in season to be reënacted by Congress in the
same code.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“No slave manumitted agreeably to the laws of this State
… shall be entitled … to give evidence against any
white person, or shall be recorded as competent evidence to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>manumit any slave petitioning for freedom.”<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And such is the law for Slavery at the national
capital.</p>

<p>It will be observed that the original statute which
undertakes to create Slavery in Maryland does not
attaint the blood beyond two generations. It is confined
to “all negroes and other slaves,” and their “children,”
“during their natural lives.” These are slaves,
but none others, unless a familiar rule of interpretation
is reversed, and such words are extended rather than
restrained. And yet it is by virtue of this colonial
statute, with all its ancillary barbarism, adopted by
Congress, that slaves are still held at the national
capital. It is true that at the time of its adoption
there were few slaves here to whom it was applicable.
For ten years previous, the present area of Washington,
according to received tradition, contained hardly
five hundred inhabitants, all told, and these were for
the most part laborers distributed in houses merely for
temporary accommodation. But all these musty, antediluvian,
wicked statutes, of which you have seen a
specimen, took their place at once in the national
legislation, and under their supposed authority slaves
multiplied, and Slavery became a national institution.
And it now continues only by virtue of this Slave
Code borrowed from early colonial days, which, though
flagrantly inconsistent with the Constitution, has never
yet been repudiated by Court or Congress.</p>

<p>I have said that this Slave Code, even assuming it
applicable to slaves beyond the “natural lives” of two
generations, is flagrantly inconsistent with the Constitution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
On this point the argument is so plain that it
may be shown like a diagram.</p>

<p>Under the Constitution, Congress has “exclusive
legislation in all cases whatsoever” at the national
capital. The cession by Maryland was without condition,
and the acceptance by Congress was also without
condition; so that the territory fell at once within this
exclusive jurisdiction. But Congress can exercise no
power except in conformity with the Constitution. Its
exclusive jurisdiction in all cases whatsoever is controlled
and limited by the Constitution, out of which it
is derived. Now, looking at the Constitution, we find,
first, that there are no words authorizing Congress to
establish or recognize Slavery, and, secondly, that there
are positive words which prohibit Congress from the
exercise of any such power. The argument, therefore,
is twofold: first, from the absence of authority, and,
secondly, from positive prohibition.</p>

<p>Of course, a barbarism like Slavery, having its origin
in force and nothing else, can have no legal or constitutional
support except from positive sanction. It can
spring from no doubtful phrase. It must be declared
by unambiguous words, incapable of a double sense.
Here I repeat an argument which I have presented
before, when on other occasions arraigning the pretensions
of Slavery under the Constitution, but which,
so long as Slavery claims immunity, cannot be allowed
to drop out of sight. It begins with the great words
of Lord Mansfield, who, in the memorable case of Somerset,
said: “The state of Slavery is of such a nature
that it is incapable of being introduced on any reasons,
moral or political, but only by <em>positive law</em>.… It is
so odious that nothing can be suffered to support it but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">positive law</span>.”<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> This principle has been adopted by
tribunals even in slaveholding States.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> But I do not
stop to dwell on these authorities. Even the language,
“exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever,” cannot
be made to sanction Slavery. It wants those positive
words, leaving nothing to implication, which are obviously
required, especially when we consider the professed
object of the Constitution, as declared in its Preamble,
to “establish justice and secure the blessings of
liberty.” There is no power in the Constitution to
make a king, or, thank God, to make a slave; and the
absence of all such power is hardly more clear in one
case than in the other. The word <em>king</em> nowhere occurs
in the Constitution, nor does the word <em>slave</em>. But if
there be no such power, then all Acts of Congress sustaining
Slavery at the national capital must be unconstitutional
and void. The stream cannot rise higher
than the fountain head; nay, more, <em>nothing can come
out of nothing</em>; and if there be nothing in the Constitution
authorizing Congress to make a slave, there can
be nothing valid in any subordinate legislation. It is a
pretension which has thus far prevailed simply because
Slavery predominated over Congress and courts.</p>

<p>To all who insist that Congress may sustain Slavery
in the national capital I put the question, Where in
the Constitution is the power found? If you cannot
show where, do not assert the power. So hideous an
effrontery must be authorized in unmistakable words.
But where are the words? In what article, clause, or
line? They cannot be found. I challenge their production.
Insult not human nature by pretending that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
its most cherished rights can be sacrificed without solemn
authority. Remember that every presumption and
every leaning must be in favor of Freedom and against
Slavery. Remember, too, that no nice interpretation, no
strained construction, no fancied deduction, can suffice
to sanction the enslavement of our fellow-men. And do
not degrade the Constitution by foisting upon its blameless
text the idea of property in man. It is not there;
and if you think you see it there, it is simply because
you make the Constitution a reflection of yourself.</p>

<p>A single illustration will show the absurdity of this
pretension. If, under the clause giving to Congress “exclusive
legislation” at the national capital, Slavery may
be established, and under these words Congress is empowered
to create slaves instead of citizens, then, under
the same words, it may do the same thing in the “forts,
magazines, arsenals, dock-yards, and other needful buildings”
belonging to the United States, wherever situated,
for these are all placed within the same “exclusive
legislation.” The extensive navy-yard at Charlestown,
in the very shadow of Bunker Hill, may be filled with
slaves, with enforced toil to take the place of that
cheerful, well-paid labor whose busy hum is the best
music of the place. Such an act, however consistent
with slaveholding tyranny, would not be regarded as
constitutional at Bunker Hill.</p>

<p>If there were any doubt on this point, and the absence
of all authority were not perfectly clear, the prohibitions
of the Constitution would settle the question.
It is true that Congress has “exclusive legislation” within
the District; but the prohibitions to grant titles of
nobility, to pass <i>ex post facto</i> laws, to pass bills of attainder,
and to establish religion, are unquestionable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
limitations of this power. There is also another limitation,
equally unquestionable. It is found in an
Amendment proposed by the First Congress, on the
recommendation of several States, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“No <span class="smcap">person</span> shall be deprived of life, <span class="smcap">liberty</span>, or property,
without <em>due process of law</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p>This prohibition, according to the Supreme Court, is
obligatory on Congress.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> It is also applicable to all
claimed as slaves; for, in the eye of the Constitution,
every human being within its sphere, whether Caucasian,
Indian, or African, from the President to the
slave, is a <em>person</em>. Of this there is no question. But
a remarkable incident of history confirms the conclusion.
As originally recommended by Virginia, North
Carolina, and Rhode Island, this proposition was restricted
to the <em>freeman</em>. Its language was,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“No <em>freeman</em> ought to be deprived of his life, <em>liberty</em>, or
property, but by the law of the land.”<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Of course, if the word <em>freeman</em> had been adopted, this
clause would be restricted in its effective power. Deliberately
rejecting this limitation, the authors of the
Amendment recorded their purpose that no <em>person</em>, within
the national jurisdiction, of whatever character, shall
be deprived of <em>liberty</em> without due process of law. The
latter words are borrowed from Magna Charta, and they
mean without due presentment, indictment, or other
judicial proceedings. But Congress, undertaking to
support Slavery at the national capital, enacts that
<em>persons</em> may be deprived of liberty there without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span> any
presentment, indictment, or other judicial proceedings.
Therefore every <em>person</em> now detained as a slave in the
national capital is detained in violation of the Constitution.
Not only is his liberty taken without due process
of law, but, since he is tyrannically despoiled of all
the fruits of his industry, his property also is taken
without due process of law. You talk sometimes of
guaranties of the Constitution. Here is an unmistakable
guaranty, and I hold you to it.</p>

<p>Bringing the argument together, the conclusion may
be briefly stated. The five-headed barbarism of Slavery,
beginning in violence, can have no legal or constitutional
existence, unless through positive words expressly
authorizing it. As no such positive words are
found in the Constitution, all legislation by Congress
supporting Slavery must be unconstitutional and void,
while it is made still further impossible by positive
words of prohibition guarding the liberty of every <em>person</em>
within the exclusive jurisdiction of Congress.</p>

<p>A court properly inspired, and ready to assume that
just responsibility which dignifies judicial tribunals,
would at once declare Slavery impossible at the national
capital, and set every slave free,&mdash;as Lord Mansfield
declared Slavery impossible in England, and set
every slave free. The two cases are parallel; but, alas!
the court is wanting here. The legality of Slavery in
England was affirmed in professional opinions by the
ablest lawyers; it was also affirmed on the bench.
England was a Slave State, and even its newspapers
were disfigured with advertisements for the sale of human
beings, while the merchants of London, backed by
great names in the law, sustained the outrage. Then
appeared Granville Sharp, the philanthropist, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
pained by the sight of Slavery, and especially shocked
by the brutality of a slave-hunt in the streets of London,
was aroused to question its constitutionality in
England. For two years he devoted himself to anxious
study of the British Constitution in all its multifarious
records. His conclusion is expressed in these precise
words: “The word <em>slaves</em>, or anything that can justify
the enslaving of others, is not to be found there, God
be thanked!”<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> Thus encouraged, he persevered. By
his generous exertions the negro Somerset, claimed as
a slave by a Virginia gentleman then in London, was
defended, and the Court of King’s Bench compelled to
that immortal judgment by which Slavery was forever
expelled from England, and the early boast of the
British Constitution became a practical verity. More
than fourteen thousand persons, held as slaves on British
soil&mdash;four times as many as are now found in the
national capital&mdash;became instantly free, without price
or ransom.</p>

<p>The good work that our courts thus far decline remains
to be done by Congress. Slavery, which is a
scandalous anomaly and anachronism here, must be
made to disappear from the national capital,&mdash;if not
in one way, then in another. A judgment of court
would be simply on the question of constitutional right,
without regard to policy. But there is no consideration
of right or of policy, from the loftiest principle to the
humblest expediency, which may not properly enter
into the conclusion of Congress. The former might
be the triumph of the magistrate,&mdash;the latter must
be that of the statesman. But whether from magistrate
or from statesman, it will constitute an epoch in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
history.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But the question is asked, Shall we vote money for
this purpose? I cannot hesitate. Two considerations
are with me prevailing. First, the relation of master
and slave at the national capital has from the beginning
been established and maintained by Congress everywhere
in sight, and even directly under its own eyes.
The master held the slave; but Congress, with strong
arm, stood behind the master, looking on and sustaining.
Not a dollar of wages has been taken, not a child stolen,
not a wife torn from her husband, without the hand of
Congress. If not partnership, there is complicity on the
part of Congress, through which the whole country has
become responsible for the manifold wrong. Though
always protesting against its continuance, and laboring
earnestly for its removal, yet gladly do I accept my
share of the prospective burden. And, secondly, even if
not all involved in the manifold wrong, nothing is clearer
than that the mode proposed is the gentlest, quietest,
and surest in which the beneficent change can be accomplished.
It is therefore the most practical. It recognizes
Slavery as an existing fact, and provides for its
removal. And when I think of the unquestionable good
we seek, of all its great advantages, of the national
capital redeemed, of the national character elevated,
and of the righteous example we shall set, and when
I think, still further, that, according to a rule alike of
jurisprudence and morals, <em>Liberty is priceless</em>, I cannot
hesitate at any appropriation within our means by
which all these things of incalculable value can be
promptly secured.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>
<p>As I find no reason of policy adverse to such appropriation,
so do I find no objection in the Constitution.
I am aware that it is sometimes asked, Where in the
Constitution is the power to make such appropriation?
But nothing is clearer than that, under the words conferring
“exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever,”
Congress may create freemen, although it may not create
slaves. And of course it may exercise all the powers
necessary to this end, whether by a simple act of emancipation
or a vote of money. If there could be any
doubt on this point, it would be removed, when we reflect
that the abolition of Slavery, with all the natural
incidents of such an act, has been constantly recognized
as within the sphere of legislation. It was so regarded
by Washington, who, in a generous letter to Lafayette,
dated May 10, 1786, said: “It certainly might and
assuredly ought to be effected, and that, too, by <em>legislative</em>
authority.”<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> Through legislative authority Slavery
has been abolished in State after State of our Union,
and also in foreign countries. I have yet to learn that
the power of Congress for this purpose at the national
capital is less complete than that of any other legislative
body within its own jurisdiction.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>But, while not doubting the power of Congress in any
of its incidents, I prefer to consider the money we pay
as in the nature of <em>ransom</em> rather than <em>compensation</em>, so
that Freedom shall be <em>acquired</em> rather than <em>purchased</em>;
and I place it at once under the sanction of that commanding
charity proclaimed by prophets and enjoined
by apostles, which all history recognizes and the Constitution
cannot impair. From time immemorial every
Government has undertaken to ransom from <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>captivity,
and sometimes a whole people has felt the general resources
well bestowed in the ransom of its prince. Religion
and humanity have both concurred in this duty
as more than usually sacred. “The ransom of captives
is a great and excellent office of justice,” exclaims one of
the early Fathers. And the pious St. Ambrose insisted
upon breaking up even the sacred vessels of the Church,
saying: “The ornament of the sacraments is the redemption
of captives.”</p>

<p>Among the most beautiful incidents of the early
Church is that of St. Ambrose. There had been hesitation,
but the divine Emancipationist broke forth:
“What! you will not sell the vessels of gold, and you
leave for sale the living vessels of the Lord! The ornament
of the sacraments is the redemption of captives.
Let the cup ransom from the enemy him whom the
blood ransoms from sin.”<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> Happily, this spirit prevailed.
At the report of Christians compelled to wear
out their days as captives in Algiers, Tunis, or Morocco,
or, it might be, among the Moors of Spain or the merchants
of Genoa and Venice, it assumed practical form.
Two Frenchmen, Jean de Matha and Pierre Nolasque,
born on the coast of the Mediterranean, conceived the
idea of a special order vowed to the redemption of
Christian slaves. The first founded, in 1199, the order
of the Holy Trinity, known often as Mathurins; the
second, acting under the patronage of Spain, founded
the order of Our Lady of Mercy. Upon both these
orders Bishops and Popes bestowed approbation and
encouragement, while, for more than six centuries, they
devoted themselves to this Christian charity, often, according
to the vow assumed, giving themselves as hostages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
for the ransomed captive. It is related, that, in
1655, the Order of Mercy in Algiers alone ransomed
more than twelve thousand slaves, leaving in pledge a
large number of its members, faithful to the vow, “<i>In
Saracenorum potestate in pignus, si necesse fuerit ad redemptionem
Christi fidelium, detentus manebo</i>.” Thus
did these pious fathers give not only money, but themselves.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>The duty thus commended has been exercised by
the United States under important circumstances, with
the coöperation of the best names of our history, so as
to be beyond question. The instance may not be familiar,
but it is decisive, while, from beginning to end, it
is full of instruction.</p>

<p>Who has not heard of the Barbary States, and of the
pretension put forth by them to enslave white Christians?
Algiers was the chief seat of this enormity,
which, through the insensibility or incapacity of Christian
States, was allowed to continue for generations.
Good men and great men were degraded to be captives,
while many, neglected by fortune, perished in barbarous
Slavery. Even in our colonial days, there were Americans
whose fate, while in the hands of these slave-masters,
excited general sympathy. Only by ransom was
their freedom obtained. Perhaps no condition was
more calculated to arouse indignant rage. And yet
the disposition so common to palliate Slavery in the
National Capital showed itself with regard to Slavery
in Algiers; and, indeed, the same arguments to soften
public opinion have been employed in the two instances.
The parallel is so complete, that I require all your trust
to believe that what I read is not an apology for Slavery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
here. Thus, a member of a diplomatic mission from England,
who visited Morocco in 1785, says of the Slavery
which he saw: “It is very slightly inflicted”; and “as
to any labor undergone, it does not deserve the name.”<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a>
And another earlier traveller, after describing the comfortable
condition of the white slaves, adds, in words to
which we are accustomed: “I am sure we saw several
captives who lived much better in Barbary than ever
they did in their own country.… Whatever money in
charity was ever sent them by their friends in Europe
was their own.… And yet this is called insupportable
slavery among Turks and Moors! But we found this,
as well as many other things in this country, strangely
misrepresented.”<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> A more recent French writer asserts,
with a vehemence to which we are habituated from the
partisans of Slavery among us, that the white slaves at
Algiers were not exposed to the miseries which they represented;
that they were well clad and well fed, <em>much
better than the free Christians there</em>; that special care
was bestowed upon those who became ill; and that
some were allowed such privileges as to become indifferent
to freedom, and even to prefer Algiers to their
own country.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Believe me, Sir, in stating these things
I simply follow history; and I refer to the volume and
page or chapter of the authorities which I quote, that
the careful inquirer may see that they relate to Slavery
abroad, and not to Slavery at home. If I continue to
unfold this strange, eventful story, it will be to exhibit
<em>the direct and constant intervention of Congress for the
ransom of slaves</em>; but the story itself is an argument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
against Slavery, pertinent to the present occasion, which
I am not unwilling to adopt.</p>

<p>Scarcely was national independence established, when
we were aroused to fresh efforts for the protection of
enslaved citizens. Within three years no less than ten
American vessels were seized. At one time an apprehension
prevailed that Dr. Franklin, on his way home
from France, had been captured. “We are waiting,”
said one of his French correspondents, “with the greatest
impatience to hear from you. The newspapers have
given us anxiety on your account, for some of them insist
that you have been taken by the Algerines, while
others pretend that you are at Morocco, enduring your
slavery with all the patience of a philosopher.”<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Though
this apprehension happily proved without foundation,
it soon became known that other Americans, less distinguished,
but entitled to all the privileges of new-born
citizenship, were suffering in cruel captivity. At once
the sentiments of the people were enlisted in their
behalf. Newspapers pleaded, while the corsairs were
denounced sometimes as “infernal crews,” and sometimes
as “human harpies.” But it was through the
stories of victims who had succeeded in escaping from
bondage that the people were most aroused. As these
fugitive slaves touched our shores, they were welcomed
with outspoken sympathy. Glimpses opened through
them into the dread regions of Slavery gave a harrowing
reality to all that conjecture or imagination had pictured.
True, indeed, it was that our own white brethren,
entitled like ourselves to all the rights of manhood,
were degraded in unquestioning obedience to an arbitrary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
taskmaster, sold at the auction-block, worked like
beasts of the field, and galled by the manacle and lash.
As the national power seemed yet inadequate to compel
their liberation, it was attempted by ransom.</p>

<p>Generous efforts at Algiers were organized under the
direction of our minister at Paris, and the famous <i>Society
of Redemption</i>, having its origin in the thirteenth century,
offered aid. Our agents were blandly entertained
by the great slave-dealer, the Dey, who informed them
that he was familiar with the exploits of Washington,
and, as he never expected to set eyes on this hero of
Freedom, expressed a hope, that, through Congress, he
might receive a full-length portrait of him, to be displayed
in the palace at Algiers. Amidst such professions
the Dey still clung to his American slaves, holding
them at prices beyond the means of the agents, who
were not authorized to exceed two hundred dollars a
head,&mdash;being not unlike in amount that proposed in
the present bill; and I beg to call the attention of the
Senator from Maine [Mr. <span class="smcap">Morrill</span>], who has the bill
in charge, to the parallel.</p>

<p>Their redemption engaged the attention of the National
Government early after the adoption of the Constitution.
It was first brought before Congress by petition,
of which we find the following record.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Friday, May 14, 1790.</i>&mdash;A petition from sundry citizens
of the United States, captured by the Algerines, and
now in slavery there, was presented, praying the interposition
of Congress in their behalf. Referred to the Secretary
of State.”<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>An interesting report on the situation of these captives
was made to the President by the Secretary of
State, December 28, 1790, where he sets forth the efforts
for their redemption at such prices as would not “raise
the market,”&mdash;it being regarded as important, that, in
“the first instance of a redemption by the United States,
our price should be fixed at the lowest point.”<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> I quote
the precise words of this document, which will be found
in the State Papers of the country, and I call special
attention to them as applicable to the present moment.
Our price should be fixed at the lowest point, and we
should do nothing to raise the market. The parallel
becomes more complete, when it is known that the
white slaves at Algiers were about the same in number
with the black slaves at Washington whose redemption
is now proposed. The report of Mr. Jefferson was laid
before Congress, with the following brief message from
the President.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium">“<span class="smcap">United States</span>, December 30, 1790.</p>

<p class="noindent">“<i>Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I lay before you a report of the Secretary of State on
the subject of the citizens of the United States in captivity
at Algiers, that you may provide on their behalf what to
you shall seem most expedient.</p>

<p class="sig">“<span class="smcap">Geo. Washington.</span>”<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It does not appear that there was question in any
quarter with regard to the power of Congress. The
broad recommendation of the President was to provide
on behalf of the slaves what should seem most
expedient.</p>

<p>Another report from the Secretary of State, entitled
“Mediterranean Trade,” and communicated to Congress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
December 30, 1790, relates chiefly to the same matter.
In this document are different estimates with regard to
the price at which our fellow-citizens might be ransomed
and peace purchased. One person, who had long resided
at Algiers, put the price at sixty or seventy thousand
pounds sterling: this was the lowest estimate. Another,
also long, and still, a resident there, said that it
could not be less than a million dollars,&mdash;which is
the sum proposed in the present bill. Mr. Jefferson,
after considering the subject at some length, concludes
as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Upon the whole, it rests with Congress to decide between
war, tribute, and ransom.… If war, they will consider
how far our own resources shall be called forth.…
If tribute or ransom, it will rest with them to limit and provide
the amount, and with the Executive, observing the same
constitutional forms, to make arrangements for employing it
to the best advantage.”<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Among the papers accompanying the report is a letter
from Mr. Adams, minister at London, from which I take
important words.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It may be reasonably concluded that this great affair
cannot be finished for much less than two hundred thousand
pounds sterling.”<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This is the very sum now needed for our great affair.</p>

<p>In pursuance of these communications, the Senate
tendered its advice to the President in a resolution.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the Senate advise and consent that the
President of the United States take such measures as he
may think necessary for the redemption of the citizens of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>the United States now in captivity at Algiers: <i>Provided</i>,
The expense shall not exceed forty thousand dollars; and
also that measures be taken to confirm the treaty now
existing between the United States and the Emperor of
Morocco.”<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In a subsequent message, February 22, 1791, the
President said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I will proceed to take measures for the ransom of our
citizens in captivity at Algiers, in conformity with your resolution
of advice of the first instant, so soon as the moneys
necessary shall be appropriated by the Legislature, and shall
be in readiness.”<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The same subject was presented again to the Senate
by President Washington, in the following inquiry,
May 8, 1792.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If the President of the United States should conclude a
convention or treaty with the Government of Algiers for the
ransom of the thirteen Americans in captivity there, for a
sum not exceeding forty thousand dollars, all expenses included,
will the Senate approve the same? Or is there any,
and what, greater or lesser sum which they would fix on
as the limit beyond which they would not approve the ransom?<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Senate promptly replied by a resolution declaring
it would approve such treaty of ransom.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> And Congress,
by Act of May 8, 1792, appropriated a sum of
fifty thousand dollars for this purpose.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Commodore
Paul Jones was intrusted with the mission to Algiers,
charged with the double duty of making peace and of
securing the redemption of our citizens. In his letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
of instructions, June 1, 1792, Mr. Jefferson considers
the rate of ransom.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It has been a fixed principle with Congress to establish
the rate of ransom of American captives with the Barbary
States at as low a point as possible, that it may not be the
interest of those States to go in quest of our citizens in preference
to those of other countries. Had it not been for the
danger it would have brought on the residue of our seamen,
by exciting the cupidity of these rovers against them, our
citizens now in Algiers would have been long ago redeemed,
without regard to price. The mere money for this particular
redemption neither has been nor is an object with anybody
here.”<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In the same instructions Mr. Jefferson says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As soon as the ransom is completed, you will be pleased
to have the captives well clothed and sent home at the expense
of the United States, with as much economy as will
consist with their reasonable comfort.”<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Commodore Paul Jones&mdash;called Admiral in the instructions&mdash;died
without entering upon these duties,
and they were afterwards undertaken by Colonel Humphreys,
our minister at Lisbon, honored especially with
the friendship of Washington, and an accomplished
officer of his staff during the Revolution. The terms
demanded by the Dey were such as to render the mission
unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Algerines seized other of our citizens,
who are described as “employed as captive slaves on
the most laborious work, in a distressed and naked
situation.”<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> One of their number, in a letter <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>to the President,
dated at Algiers, November 5, 1793, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Humanity towards the unfortunate American captives,
I presume, will induce your Excellency to coöperate with
Congress to adopt some speedy and effectual plan in order
to restore to liberty and finally extricate the American captives
from their present distresses.”<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At this time one hundred and nineteen American
slaves in Algiers united in a petition to Congress, dated
December 29, 1793, where they say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Your petitioners are at present captives in this city of
bondage, employed daily on the most laborious work, without
any respect to persons.… They pray you will take
their unfortunate situation into consideration, and adopt
such measures as will restore the American captives to their
country, their friends, families, and connections.”<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The country was now aroused. A general contribution
was proposed. People of all classes vied in generous
effort. Newspapers entered with increased activity
into the work. At public celebrations the toasts, “Happiness
for all,” and “Universal Liberty,” were proposed,
partly in sympathy with our wretched white fellow-countrymen
in bonds. On one occasion, at a patriotic
festival in New Hampshire, they were distinctly remembered
in the toast: “Our brethren in slavery at Algiers.
May the measures adopted for their redemption be successful,
and may they live to rejoice with their friends
in the blessings of liberty!”<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> The clergy, too, were enlisted.
A fervid appeal by the captives themselves was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
addressed to ministers of the Gospel throughout the
United States, asking them to set apart a special Sunday
for sermons in behalf of their enslaved brethren.
Literature added her influence, not only in essays, but
in a work, which, though now forgotten, was among
the earliest of the literary productions of our country,
reprinted in London at a time when few American
books were known abroad. I refer to the story of “The
Algerine Captive,” which, though published anonymously,
like other similar works at a later day, is known to
have been written by Royall Tyler, afterwards Chief
Justice of Vermont. Slavery in Algiers is here delineated
in the sufferings of a single captive,&mdash;as Slavery
in the United States has been since depicted in the sufferings
of “Uncle Tom”; but the argument of the early
story was hardly less strong against African Slavery
than against White Slavery. “Grant me,” says the
Algerine captive&mdash;who had been a surgeon on board
a ship in the African slave-trade&mdash;from the depths of
his own sorrows, “once more to taste the freedom of
my native country, and every moment of my life shall
be dedicated to preaching against this detestable commerce.
I will fly to our fellow-citizens in the Southern
States; I will on my knees conjure them, in the name
of humanity, to abolish a traffic which causes it to
bleed in every pore. If they are deaf to the pleadings
of Nature, I will conjure them, for the sake of consistency,
to cease to deprive their fellow-creatures of freedom,
which their writers, their orators, Representatives,
Senators, and even their Constitutions of Government,
have declared to be the unalienable birthright of man.”<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>
In such words was the cause of Emancipation pleaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
at that early day.</p>

<p>From his distant mission at Lisbon, Colonel Humphreys,
yet unable to reach Algiers, joined in this appeal
by a letter to the American people, dated July 11,
1794. Taking advantage of the general interest in lotteries,
and particularly of the custom, not then condemned,
of employing these to obtain money for literary
or benevolent purposes, he suggests a grand lottery,
sanctioned by the United States, or particular lotteries
in individual States, to obtain the means required for
the ransom of our countrymen. He then asks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Is there within the limits of these United States an individual
who will not cheerfully contribute in proportion to
his means to carry it into effect? By the peculiar blessings
of freedom which you enjoy, by the disinterested sacrifices
you made for its attainment, by the patriotic blood of those
martyrs of Liberty who died to secure your independence,
and by all the tender ties of Nature, let me conjure you
once more to snatch your unfortunate countrymen from fetters,
dungeons, and death.”</p>

</div>

<p>Meanwhile the Government was energetic through
all its agents, at home and abroad; nor was any question
raised with regard to constitutional powers. In
the animated debate which ensued in the House of
Representatives, an honorable member said, “If bribery
would not do, he should certainly vote for equipping a
fleet.”<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> At last, by Act of Congress of the 20th March,
1794, a million dollars was appropriated for this purpose,
being the identical sum now proposed for a similar
purpose of redemption; but it was somewhat masked
under the language, “to defray any expenses which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span> may
be incurred in relation to the intercourse between the
United States and foreign nations.”<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> On the same day,
by another Act, the President was authorized “to borrow,
on the credit of the United States, if in his opinion
the public service shall require it, a sum not exceeding
one million of dollars.”<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> The object was distinctly
avowed in the instructions of Mr. Jefferson, 28th March,
1795, “for concluding a treaty of peace and liberating
our citizens from captivity.” In other instructions,
25th August of the preceding year, the wishes of the
President are thus conveyed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Ransom and peace are to go hand and hand, if practicable;
but if peace cannot be obtained, a ransom is to be effected
without delay, … restricting yourself, on the head
of a ransom, within the limit of three thousand dollars per
man.”<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The negotiation being consummated, the first tidings
of its success were announced to Congress by President
Washington in his speech at the opening of the session,
8th December, 1795.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“With peculiar satisfaction I add, that information has
been received from an agent deputed on our part to Algiers,
importing that the terms of a treaty with the Dey and Regency
of that country had been adjusted in such a manner
as to authorize the expectation of a speedy peace, and the
restoration of our unfortunate fellow-citizens from a grievous
captivity.”<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The treaty was signed at Algiers, 5th September,
1795. It was a sacrifice of pride, if not of honor, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
necessity of the occasion. Among its stipulations was
one even for annual tribute to the barbarous Slave
Power.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> But, amidst all its unquestionable humiliation,
it was a treaty of Emancipation; nor did our people
consider nicely the terms on which this good was
secured. It is recorded that a thrill of joy went through
the land on the annunciation that a vessel had left
Algiers having on board the Americans who had been
captives there. The largess of money, and even the
indignity of tribute, were forgotten in gratulations on
their new-found happiness. Washington, in his speech
to Congress of December 7, 1796, thus solemnly dwelt
on their emancipation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“After many delays and disappointments, arising out of
the European war, the final arrangements for fulfilling the
engagements made to the Dey and Regency of Algiers will,
in all present appearance, be crowned with success,&mdash;but under
great, though inevitable, disadvantages in the pecuniary
transactions, occasioned by that war, which will render a
further provision necessary. <em>The actual liberation of all
our citizens who were prisoners in Algiers, while it gratifies
every feeling heart</em>, is itself an earnest of a satisfactory termination
of the whole negotiation.”<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Other treaties were made with Tripoli and Morocco,
and more money was paid for the same object,
until at last, in 1801, the slaveholding pretensions of
Tripoli compelled a resort to arms. By a document
preserved in the State Papers of our country, it appears
that from 1791, in the space of ten years, appropriations
were made for the liberation of our people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
reaching to a sum-total of more than two millions of
dollars.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> To all who question the power of Congress,
or the policy of exercising it, I commend this account,
in its various items, given with authentic minuteness.
If we consider the population and resources of the
country at the time, as compared with our present
gigantic means, the amount will not be deemed inconsiderable.</p>

<p>The pretensions of Tripoli brought out Colonel Humphreys,
the former companion of Washington, now at
home in retirement. In an address to the public, he
called again for united action, saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Americans of the United States, your fellow-citizens are
in fetters! Can there be but one feeling? Where are the
gallant remnants of the race who fought for freedom? Where
the glorious heirs of their patriotism? <em>Will there never be
a truce between political parties? Or must it forever be the
fate of free States, that the soft voice of union should be
drowned in the hoarse clamor of discord?</em> No! Let every
friend of blessed humanity and sacred freedom entertain a
better hope and confidence.”<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then commenced those early deeds by which our
arms became known in Europe,&mdash;the best achievement
of Decatur, and the romantic expedition of Eaton.
Three several times Tripoli was attacked; and yet,
after successes sometimes mentioned with pride, our
country consented by solemn treaty to pay sixty thousand
dollars for the freedom of two hundred American
slaves, and thus again by money obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
Emancipation.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> But Algiers was governed by Slavery as a ruling
passion. Again our people were seized. Even the absorbing
contest with Great Britain could not prevent
an outbreak of indignant sympathy for those in bonds.
A naval force, promptly despatched to the Mediterranean,
was sufficient to secure the freedom of the
American slaves without ransom, and the further stipulation
that hereafter no Americans should be made
slaves, and that “any Christians whatsoever, captives
in Algiers,” making their escape and taking refuge on
board an American ship of war, should be safe from all
requisition or reclamation.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> Decatur, on this occasion,
showed character as well as courage. The freedmen of
his arms were welcomed on board his ship with impatient
triumph. Thus, by war, and not by money, was
Emancipation this time obtained.</p>

<p>At a later day, Great Britain, weary of tribute and
ransom, directed her naval power against the Barbary
States. Tunis and Tripoli each promised Abolition, but
Algiers sullenly refused, until compelled by irresistible
force. Before night, on the 27th August, 1816, the fleet
fired, besides shells and rockets, one hundred and eighteen
tons of powder and fifty thousand shot, weighing
more than five hundred tons. Amidst the crumbling
ruins of walls and citadel, the cruel Slave Power was
humbled, and by solemn stipulation consented to the
surrender of all slaves in Algiers, and the abolition of
White Slavery forever. This great triumph was announced
by the victorious admiral in a despatch to his
Government, where he uses words of rejoicing worthy
of the occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“In all the vicissitudes of a long life of public service, no
circumstance has ever produced on my mind such impressions
of gratitude and joy as the event of yesterday. To have
been one of the humble instruments in the hands of Divine
Providence for bringing to reason a ferocious Government,
and destroying forever the insufferable and horrid system of
Christian Slavery, can never cease to be a source of delight
and heartfelt comfort to every individual happy enough to
be employed in it.”<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And thus ended White Slavery in the Barbary States.
A single brief effort of war put an instant close to the
wicked pretension. If, in looking back upon its history,
we find much to humble our pride, if we are disposed to
mourn that the National Government stooped to ransom
men justly free without price, yet we cannot fail to gather
instruction from this great precedent. Slavery is the
same in essential character, wherever it exists,&mdash;except,
perhaps, that it has received new harshness here among
us. There is no argument against its validity at Algiers
not equally strong against its validity at Washington.
In both cases it is <em>unjust</em> <span class="smcap">force</span> organized into
law. But in Algiers it is not known that the law was
unconstitutional, as it clearly is here in Washington.
In the early case, Slavery was regarded by our fathers
only as an existing <span class="smcap">fact</span>; and it is only as an existing
<span class="smcap">fact</span> that it can be regarded by us in the present case;
nor is there any power of Congress, generously exerted
for those distant captives, which may not be invoked
for the captives in our own streets.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. President, if, in this important discussion, which
seems to open the door of the future, I confine myself
to two simple inquiries, it is because practically they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
exhaust the whole subject. If Slavery be unconstitutional
in the national capital, and if it be a Christian
duty, sustained by constitutional examples, to ransom
slaves, then your swift desires will not hesitate to adopt
the present bill. It is needless to enter upon other
questions, important perhaps, but irrelevant. It is needless,
also, to consider the objections which Senators have
introduced, for all must see that they are but bugbears.</p>

<p>If I seem to dwell on details, it is because they furnish
at each stage instruction and support; if I occupy
time on a curious passage of history, it is because
it is more apt even than curious, while it sometimes
holds the mirror up to our own wickedness, and sometimes
even seems to cry out, “Thou art the man!” I
scorn to argue the obvious truth that the slaves here are
as much entitled to freedom as the white slaves that enlisted
the early energies of the new-born nation. They
are <em>men</em> by the grace of God, and this is enough. There
is no principle of the Constitution, and no rule of justice,
which is not as strong for one as for the other.
Consenting to the ransom proposed, you recognize their
manhood, and if authority be needed, you find it in the
example of Washington, who did not hesitate to employ
a golden key to open the house of bondage.</p>

<p>Let this bill pass, and then will be accomplished the
first practical triumph of Freedom, for which good men
have longed, dying without the sight,&mdash;for which a
whole generation has petitioned, and for which orators
and statesmen have pleaded. Slavery will be banished
from the national capital. This metropolis, bearing a
venerated name, will be exalted, its evil spirit cast out,
its shame removed, its society refined, its courts made
just, its revolting ordinances swept away, and even its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
loyalty assured. If not moved by justice to the slave,
then be willing to act for your own good and in self-defence.
If you hesitate to pass this bill for the blacks,
then pass it for the whites. Nothing is clearer than
that the degradation of Slavery affects the master as
well as the slave; while also recent events testify, that,
wherever Slavery exists, there Treason lurks, if it does
not flaunt. From the beginning of this Rebellion, Slavery
has been constantly manifest in the conduct of the
masters, and even here in the national capital it is the
traitorous power encouraging and strengthening the enemy.
This power must be suppressed at every cost;
and if its suppression here endangers Slavery elsewhere,
there will be new motive for determined action.</p>

<p>Amidst all present solicitudes, the future cannot be
doubtful. At the national capital Slavery will give way
to Freedom. But the good work will not stop here: it
must proceed. What God and Nature decree Rebellion
cannot arrest. And as the whole wide-spread tyranny
begins to tumble, then, above the din of battle, sounding
from the sea and echoing along the land, above even the
exultations of victory on hard-fought fields, will ascend
voices of gladness and benediction, swelling from generous
hearts, wherever civilization bears sway, to commemorate
a sacred triumph, whose trophies, instead of
tattered banners, are ransomed slaves.</p>

OF SLAVERY.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Resolution and Remarks in the Senate, April 1, 1862.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sumner offered the following resolution, and then spoke upon it.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the Select Committee on the Conduct of the War be
directed to collect the evidence with regard to the barbarous treatment by
the Rebels at Manassas of the remains of officers and soldiers of the United
States killed in battle there, and to report the same to the Senate, with
power to send for persons and papers.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;We have all been shocked,
during the last few days, by the evidence that
has accumulated with regard to the treatment of our
dead at Manassas.</p>

<p>Instead of those honorable rites which in all ages
generous soldiers have been glad to bestow upon enemies
fallen in battle, we are disgusted by barbarities
reminding us of savage life. Bodies have been dug up,
and human bones carried off as trophies. The skull
of a gallant Massachusetts soldier has been converted
into the drinking-cup of a Georgia colonel, that he
may, far away among his slaves, renew the festive
barbarism of another age under the name of “The
Feast of Skulls.”</p>

<p>It is obvious, Sir, that we are now in conflict with
beings who belong to a different plane of civilization
from ourselves, and it is important that this unquestionable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
fact should be made known to the country and
to the world.</p>

<p>All familiar with recent events will remember the
effect with which that great minister, Cavour, when
on the eve of the war for Italian liberation, put forth
his circular, setting forth the outrages of the Austrian
soldiers on the Italian inhabitants. Through that appeal,
Sir, he secured the general sympathy of Europe
and of the civilized world. Our cause needs no such
document; but I am anxious, nevertheless, for the sake
of history, that the record should be made.</p>

<p>Let it be made, also, that the country and mankind
may see how Slavery in all its influences is barbarous,&mdash;barbarous
in peace, barbarous in war, barbarous always,
and nothing but barbarism.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>On motion of Mr. Howard, the resolution was amended by adding:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And that the said Select Committee also inquire into the fact, whether
Indian savages have been employed by the Rebels in their military service
against the Government of the United States, and how such warfare has
been conducted by said savages, and to report the same to the Senate, with
power to send for persons and papers.”</p>

</div>

<p>The resolution as amended was adopted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>April 30, Mr. Wade, Chairman of the Committee, reported particularly
on that part of the resolution moved by Mr. Sumner, and the next
day the Senate ordered fifty thousand extra copies of the report. Its
conclusions appear in the following painful passage.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The outrages upon the dead will revive the recollections of the cruelties
to which savage tribes subject their prisoners. They were buried, in many
cases, naked, with their faces downward; they were left to decay in the
open air; their bones were carried off as trophies, sometimes, as the testimony
proves, to be used as personal adornments; and one witness deliberately
avers that the head of one of our most gallant officers was cut off by a
Secessionist, to be turned into a drinking-cup on the occasion of his marriage.
Monstrous as this revelation may appear to be, your Committee have
been informed, that, during the last two weeks, the skull of a Union soldier
has been exhibited in the office of the sergeant-at-arms of the House of Representatives,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>which had been converted to such a purpose, and which had
been found on the person of one of the Rebel prisoners taken in a recent
conflict.”<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>The report sustained the allegations of Mr. Sumner, when he moved
the inquiry, besides giving new force to the term “The Barbarism of
Slavery.”</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;In addressing the Senate on
this bill, urging the duty of ransom, I exposed
an early, inhuman, and wicked statute of Maryland,
belonging to that offensive mass originally adopted at
the time of the cession as the law of the District, and
ever since recognized, although never voted on, and
having only a surreptitious authority. I refer to that
unjust statute making colored persons incompetent to
testify, where a white is a party. I quoted the precise
words, still the law of the District.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> No language of
mine is strong enough to express the detestation such
a contrivance is calculated to arouse in every bosom not
entirely given over to injustice.</p>

<p>The time has come for a change. At least, while
providing for the release of those now detained in Slavery,&mdash;unconstitutionally,
as I hold,&mdash;we must see that
the proceedings are without embarrassment from that
outrageous statute. I propose an amendment, and here
I have the consent of my friend, the chairman of the
Committee [Mr. <span class="smcap">Morrill</span>], in the hope of removing this
grievance in the inquiries under the bill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>The bill provides for something like a tribunal, as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They [the Commissioners] shall have power to subpœna
and compel the attendance of witnesses, and to receive testimony
and enforce its production, as in civil cases before
courts of justice.”</p>

</div>

<p>Under this provision the old Maryland statute is left
in full force. This should not be.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sumner moved to add at the end of this clause, immediately
after “courts of justice,” the words “without the exclusion of any
witness on account of color.”</p>

<p>Mr. Saulsbury, of Delaware, called for the yeas and nays, which were
ordered, and, being taken, resulted, yeas 26, nays 10. So the amendment
was agreed to.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This was the first step for the civil rights of colored persons, but
it was limited to proceedings under the Emancipation Act in the District
of Columbia.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>July 7th, the Senate having under consideration a Supplementary
Bill on Emancipation in the District, Mr. Sumner took occasion
to broaden the immunity by moving the following additional
section:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>And be it further enacted</i>, That in all judicial proceedings in the District
of Columbia there shall be no exclusion of any witness on account
of color.”</p>

</div>

<p>The yeas and nays were ordered, at the call of Mr. Powell, of Kentucky,
and, being taken, resulted, yeas 25, nays 11.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the House of Representatives, while the bill was under consideration,
Mr. Wickliffe, of Kentucky, said: “I have no hope of success;
but I feel it to be my duty to move to strike out the words
‘without the exclusion of any witness on account of color,’ where
they occur.… I presume it is intended to let a man’s servant
come in and swear that he is a disloyal man. I do hope the friends
of this bill will not so far outrage the laws of this District as to
authorize slaves or free negroes to be witnesses in cases of this kind.”
Mr. Thaddeus Stevens said, “I trust that this Committee [of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>whole House] will not so far continue an outrage as not to allow
any man of credit, whether he be black or white, to be a witness”;

<p>In his Annual Message at the beginning of this session of Congress,
December, 1861, the President said: “If any good reason exists why
we should persevere longer in withholding our recognition of the independence
and sovereignty of Hayti and Liberia, I am unable to discern
it. Unwilling, however, to inaugurate a novel policy in regard
to them without the approbation of Congress, I submit for your consideration
the expediency of an appropriation for maintaining a Chargé
d’Affaires near each of those new states. It does not admit of doubt
that important commercial advantages might be secured by favorable
treaties with them.”</p>

<p>Until this recommendation, Hayti and Liberia had borne the ban of
the colored race. The National Government, so long as it was ruled
by Slavery, could not tolerate a Black Republic. A few extracts exhibit
the indecency of the opposition. Mr. Hayne, of South Carolina,
announced: “Our policy with regard to Hayti is plain: we never can
acknowledge her independence. Let our Government direct all our
ministers in South America and Mexico to <em>protest</em> against the independence
of Hayti.” Mr. Hamilton, of South Carolina, declared the
sentiments of the Southern people to be, “that Haytien independence
is not to be tolerated in any form.” Mr. Berrien, of Georgia, said:
“Consistently with their own safety, can the people of the South permit
the intercourse which would result from establishing relations of
any sort with Hayti?” Even Mr. Benton, of Missouri, joined with
the rest: “The peace of eleven States in this Union will not permit
the fruits of a successful negro insurrection to be exhibited among
them.”<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> On the presentation of a petition in the House of Representatives,
December 18, 1838, praying for the establishment of international
relations with the Republic of Hayti, there was an outburst.
Mr. Legaré, of South Carolina, known as an accomplished scholar, exclaimed:
“The memorial originates in a design to revolutionize the
South and to convulse the Union, and ought, therefore, to be rejected
with reprobation. As sure as you live, Sir, if this course is permitted
to go on, the sun of this Union will go down,&mdash;it will go down in
blood, and go down to rise no more. I will vote unhesitatingly against
nefarious designs like these. They are treason.” Mr. Wise, of Virginia,
spoke in the same tone.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> Such was the prevailing spirit. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>time had come for a change.</p>

<p>December 4, 1861, on motion of Mr. Sumner, so much of the President’s
Message as related to the establishment of diplomatic relations
with the Governments of Hayti and Liberia was referred to the Committee
on Foreign Relations.</p>

<p>December 9th, on motion of Mr. Sumner, all memorials, resolutions
of Legislatures, and other papers on the files of the Senate, relating to
the recognition of Hayti and Liberia, were taken from the files and referred
to the Committee on Foreign Relations. Mr. Sumner stated, that
he wished to reach papers as far back as 1852,&mdash;that among these was
a very important paper, which at the time passed under the eye of Mr.
Webster, from the mercantile interest of New England, strongly in
favor of the recognition of Hayti.</p>

<p>The subject was carefully considered in committee.</p>

<p>February 4, 1862, Mr. Sumner reported from the Committee a bill,
which was read and passed to a second reading, to authorize the President
of the United States to appoint diplomatic representatives to
the Republics of Hayti and Liberia respectively, each representative
so appointed to be accredited as Commissioner and Consul-General, the
representative in Hayti to receive the compensation of Commissioner
according to the Act of Congress of August 18, 1856, being $7,500, and
the representative in Liberia not more than $4,000.</p>

<p>April 23d, on motion of Mr. Sumner, the Senate proceeded to consider
the bill, when Mr. Sumner spoke as follows.</p>

<h3>SPEECH.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;The independence of Hayti
and Liberia has never been acknowledged by our
Government down to this day. It is within the province
of the President to do this at any time, either by
receiving a diplomatic representative or by sending one.
The action of Congress is not necessary, except so far as
an appropriation is needed to sustain a mission. But
the President has seen fit, in his Annual Message, to
invite such action. By this bill Congress will associate
itself with him in the acknowledgment, which, viewed
only as an act of justice, comity, and good neighborhood,
must commend itself to all candid minds.</p>

<p>In all respects Hayti and Liberia fulfil the requirements
of International Law. Our acknowledgment can
raise no question with any foreign power. Independent
in fact, and with a civil government in successful
operation, these two Republics are entitled to hospitable
recognition in the Family of Nations, according to
the rule already established by our Government.</p>

<p>In proposing to appoint diplomatic representatives,
we necessarily contemplate the negotiation of treaties
and the establishment of friendly relations with these
two Republics under the sanctions of International Law,
and according to the usage of nations. If it be important
that such treaties should be negotiated and such
relations be established, then the present bill <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>is entitled
to support. Thus far our Government, habitually hospitable
to all newly formed republics, has turned aside
from Hayti and Liberia, although the former has been
an independent power for nearly sixty years, and the
latter for nearly fifteen. Our national character has suffered
from such conduct, while important commercial
relations with these countries have continued without
the customary support of treaties or the active protection
afforded by the presence of an honored representative.
It is time to end this anomalous state of things.</p>

<p>The arguments for the recognition of Hayti loom like
her own mountains as the mariner approaches the beautiful
island, rising higher and higher, while the head of
the last purple peak is lost in the clouds; and the arguments
for the recognition of Liberia are not inferior in
character.</p>

<p>It was my purpose originally to consider this question
in some of its larger aspects, to trace the character
and history of the two Republics, to exhibit the struggles
in our own country for the acknowledgment of their
independence, and to vindicate this act in its manifest
relations to civilization. I am happy to believe that
such a discussion is unnecessary, and shall therefore
content myself with a few considerations exclusively
practical in character, and especially in reply to the
assertion that diplomatic representatives are not needed
in our concerns with these two Republics.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hayti is one of the most charming and important
islands in the world, possessing remarkable advantages
in size, situation, climate, soil, productions, and mineral
wealth. In length, from east to west, it is about three
hundred and thirty-eight miles; and in breadth, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
north to south, it varies from one hundred and forty-five
miles to seventeen. Its circumference, without including
bays, measures eight hundred and forty-eight miles.
Its surface, exclusive of adjacent islands, is estimated at
thirty thousand five hundred and twenty-eight square
miles,&mdash;being about the area of Ireland, and nearly half
that of New England. In size it is so considerable as
to attract attention among the islands of the world. In
situation it is commanding, being at the entrance to the
Gulf of Mexico, and within easy reach of all the islands
there. In climate it is salubrious, with natural heats
tempered by sea-breezes. In soil, it is rich with tropical
luxuriance, various with mountains and plains, watered
by numerous rivers, and dotted with lakes. In productions
it is abundant beyond even the ordinary measure
of such favored regions. The mountains yield mahogany,
satin-wood, and lignum-vitæ, while the plains supply
all the bountiful returns of the tropics, including
bananas, oranges, pine-apples, coffee, cacao, sugar, indigo,
and cotton. Among the minerals are gold, silver, platinum,
mercury, copper, iron, sulphur, and several kinds
of precious stones. Such, in brief, is the physical character
of this wonderful island, which, like Ireland, is a
“gem of the sea.”</p>

<p>Originally discovered by Christopher Columbus, who
named it Hispaniola, or Little Spain, the island was for
a long time among the most valued possessions of Spain,
from which power the western portion, known as Hayti,
passed to France. Throwing off the government of the
latter country, the Republic of Hayti for nearly sixty
years has maintained its independence before the world,
and performed honorably all its duties in the family of
nations. At one time it embraced the whole island: at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
present it occupies a portion only, with a population
of six hundred thousand.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Republic of Liberia extends along the western
coast of Africa for a space of five hundred miles, beginning
at the British colony of Sierra Leone, with an average
breadth of fifty miles, between latitude 4° 20´ and
7° 20´ north, embracing an area of thirty thousand
square miles, being almost precisely the area of Hayti,&mdash;so
that these two regions, one an island and the other
a strip of African sea-coast, are of equal geographical extent.
I say nothing of the origin of this republic, although
it cannot be contemplated without the conviction
that perhaps it is one of the most important colonies
ever planted. At last civilization obtains foothold in
Africa, almost under the equator.</p>

<p>In soil and productions, if not in climate, this region
is hardly less favored than Hayti. Though so near the
equator, the mercury seldom rises above ninety degrees
in the shade, and never falls below sixty. Most of the
productions in one are also found in the other. But
Liberia abounds in iron ore. Copper and other metals
are said to exist in the interior. It is, however, in sugar,
cotton, coffee, and palm-oil that Liberia seems destined
to excel. A person familiar with the country reports
that it “bids fair to become one of the greatest sugar-producing
countries in the world.” The population embraces
some fifteen thousand persons, emigrants, or their
children, from the United States, with a large native
population, held in subjection and already won toward
civilization, amounting to more than two hundred thousand.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>
<p>With two countries like these the argument for treaties
is strong, without pursuing the inquiry further. But
it becomes irresistible, when we consider the positive
demands of our commerce in these quarters. Even in
spite of coldness, neglect, and injustice, our commercial
relations have grown there to great importance. If
assured of the customary protection afforded by treaties
and the watchful presence of a diplomatic representative,
they must become of greater importance
still.</p>

<p>I have in my hands a tabular statement of our commerce
and navigation with foreign countries for the year
ending June 30, 1860, arranged according to amount,
so that the country with the largest commercial intercourse
stands first. This authentic testimony has been
prepared at the Treasury Department, under my directions,
for this occasion. Though most interesting and
instructive, it is too minute to be read in debate.
Here, under one head, are the exports from the United
States; under another head, the imports; and, under
other heads, the number of ships and tonnage: the
whole so classified that we see at a glance the relative
importance of foreign countries in their commercial
relations with the United States.<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> Such a statement
is in itself an argument.</p>

<p>It is to exhibit the precise position of Hayti and Liberia
in the scale that I introduce this table. When it
is said that out of seventy-one countries Hayti stands
the <em>twenty-seventh</em>, and Liberia at least helps to make the
<em>twenty-ninth</em>, this is not enough. It must be observed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
that there are no less than ten countries, like Canada
and Cuba, which, though enumerated separately, belong
to other nationalities. If these are excluded, or added
to their proper nationalities, Hayti will rank as <em>seventeenth</em>,
and Liberia will take her place as <em>nineteenth</em>. But
if we examine this table in detail, we find the important
relative position of these two countries amply sustained.
Confining ourselves for the present to Hayti, we have
these remarkable results.</p>

<p>Hayti, in exports received from us, stands next to
Russia. The exports to Hayti are $2,673,682; while
those to Russia amount to $2,786,835. But the imports
from Hayti are $2,062,723, while those from Russia
are only $1,545,164. In number of vessels employed,
Hayti is much the more important to us. Only sixty
vessels are employed between the United States and
Russia, while four hundred and ninety are employed
between the United States and Hayti. So that, in importance
of commercial relations, Hayti stands above
Russia, where we have been constantly represented by
a Minister Plenipotentiary of the highest class, with a
Secretary of Legation, and have at this moment no less
than eight consuls besides.</p>

<p>According to this table, there are no less than <em>fifteen</em>
countries with which the United States maintain
diplomatic relations, although lower than Hayti in the
scale of commerce and navigation. This is not all. In
point of fact, there are at least <em>three</em> other countries,
where we are now represented by a Minister Resident,
which do not appear in any commercial tables: I refer
to Switzerland, Paraguay, and Bolivia. So that there
are as many as <em>eighteen</em> countries of less commercial
importance than Hayti, with which the United States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
are now in diplomatic relations.</p>

<p>The exports to Austria, including Venice, where we
are represented by a Minister Plenipotentiary of the
first class, with a Secretary of Legation and three consuls,
are less than one half our exports to Hayti, while
the number of ships in this commerce is only forty-five,
being four hundred and forty-five less than in our commerce
with Hayti. The exports to Peru, where we are
represented also by a Minister Plenipotentiary of the
first class, with a Secretary of Legation and five consuls,
are still less than those to Austria.</p>

<p>In this scale of commerce and navigation Hayti
stands above Prussia, where we are represented by a
Minister Plenipotentiary, and also above Sweden, Turkey,
Central America, Portugal, the Papal States, Japan,
Denmark, and Ecuador, where we are represented by
Ministers Resident. It also stands above the Sandwich
Islands, where we are represented by a Commissioner.
Of these there are several whose combined commerce
with the United States is inferior to that of Hayti.
This is the case with Sweden, Turkey, Portugal, Japan,
Denmark, and Ecuador, which altogether do not
equal Hayti in commercial relations with the United
States.</p>

<p>Our combined exports to Turkey in Europe and Turkey
in Asia are nearly two millions less than to Hayti;
and yet, with this Mohammedan Government we have
felt it important within a few weeks to negotiate a
treaty of commerce.</p>

<p>The commerce with China is among the most valuable
we possess, and the ships engaged in it are of
large size; but in number they are inferior to those
engaged in trade with Hayti. And yet at China we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
have a Minister Plenipotentiary of the first class, with
a salary of twelve thousand dollars, an interpreter with
a salary of five thousand dollars, two consuls with salaries
each of four thousand dollars, one other consul
with a salary of three thousand five hundred dollars,
two other consuls with salaries each of three thousand
dollars, and two other consuls paid by fees.</p>

<p>Perhaps the comparison between Hayti and the Sandwich
Islands is the most instructive. Both are islands
independent in government,&mdash;Hayti with a population
of six hundred thousand, the Sandwich Islands with a
population of little more than seventy thousand. The
exports to Hayti, as we have already seen, are $2,673,682,
while the exports to the Sandwich Islands are only
$747,462. And the difference in navigation is as
great. In commerce with Hayti there are four hundred
and ninety ships, with an aggregate of 82,360
tons, while in commerce with the Sandwich Islands
there are only eighty-five ships, with an aggregate of
35,368 tons. And yet, at the Sandwich Islands, with
this inferior population, inferior commerce, and inferior
navigation, we are represented by a Commissioner, with
a salary of seven thousand five hundred dollars, one
consul with a salary of four thousand dollars, another
consul with a salary of three thousand dollars, and still
another paid by fees.</p>

<p>Nor is the interest in the trade with Hayti confined
to any particular State or section of the United States.
From other authentic tables it appears that the New
England States send fish and cheap cottons,&mdash;Pennsylvania
and the Western States send pork,&mdash;Vermont,
New York, Ohio, and Illinois send beef, butter, and
cheese,&mdash;Philadelphia and Boston send soap and cand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>les,&mdash;while
Maine sends lumber, and in times past
Southern States have sent rice and tobacco.</p>

<p>Of fish Hayti in 1859-60 took from us 55,652 cwt.,
being much more than was taken by any other country,
except Cuba, which took 59,719 cwt., and much more
than was taken by all the rest of the West Indies. Of
cotton manufactures Hayti took from us to the value
of $227,717, being more than was taken by many other
countries together, and nearly double the amount taken
by Cuba and Porto Rico together, the two remaining,
but valuable, American possessions of Spain. Of butter
Hayti took 211,644 pounds, of cheese 121,137 pounds,
of lard 675,163 pounds,&mdash;but of soap she took 2,602,132
pounds, being three times as much as was taken
by any other country. Cuba, which stands next, took
only 867,823 pounds, while Mexico took only 66,874
pounds.<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>Such are some of the articles, which I mention that
you may see the distribution of this commerce in our
own country, as well as the extent to which, though
pursued under difficulties, it has already gone.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The practical advantages from the recognition of
Hayti were directly urged upon the National Government
by one of its agents, even during the unfriendly
administration of President Pierce. I refer to the consular
return of John L. Wilson, commercial agent at
Cape Haytien, under date of June 5, 1854, as follows.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“By a recognition of the independence of Hayti our commerce
would be likely to advance still more. Our citizens
trading there would enjoy more privileges, besides standing
on a better footing. <em>Many decided advantages might also
be obtained through treaty</em>, and our own Government exercise
a wholesome influence over theirs, of which it stands
much in need.”<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This is certainly strong testimony, although, when we
consider his political relations, testimony from an unwilling
witness. There is other testimony of a similar
character. In the text of the elaborate report by the
Department of State, from which the above is taken, is
found the following weighty opinion.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“There being no treaty between the United States and
Hayti, the commerce between the two countries is governed
by such local laws and regulations as may from time to
time be enacted. These are always subject to changes and
alterations, sometimes so sudden,&mdash;decrees of to-day superseding
the laws in force but yesterday,&mdash;that commercial
interests, <em>especially those of the United States</em>, have been in
many instances most seriously affected.”<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

</div>

<p>As late as June 25, 1850, a law was in force which
subjected the vessels of all countries not acknowledging
the independence of Hayti to an additional duty of ten
per cent. American vessels, being within its operation,
could not compete with the vessels of other nations,
even in exporting to Hayti our own staples. Then,
again, there was a tariff, that took effect in January,
1850, under which there was a most injurious
discrimination against our trade. A despatch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span> at that
period from Aux Cayes to the Department of State
says: “While the citizens of France are scarcely affected
in their importations to Hayti, the Americans
here import, and our merchants at home export, scarcely
any article that is free.” And yet, in the face of
these annoyances, and notwithstanding the embarrassments
which they occasioned, our merchants have secured
at least a moiety of the foreign trade of Hayti.
With the encouragements bestowed on our relations
with other countries, we shall enjoy a much larger proportion.<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>If any additional motive were needed, it might be
found in the political condition of the West India
Islands, and the present movements in Mexico. Spain,
quickened by ancient pride, has begun to recover her
former foothold,<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> and it is sometimes supposed that
France is willing to profit by imagined change of sentiment
in her favor. Thus far the Republic of Hayti has
been left without sympathy or support from our country.
That it is able to sustain itself so well gives assurance
of still greater strength, when surrounded by
more auspicious circumstances. Nor is the influence of
Hayti to be neglected in adjusting that balance of power
which is daily becoming of increased importance in the
West Indies. It may be of value to us that this republic
should be among our friends, while it cannot be
doubted that our friendship will contribute to Haytien
security against danger from any quarter whatsoever.
It will be remembered that Mr. Canning boasted, somewhat
grandly, that he called a new world into existence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
to redress the balance of the old,&mdash;alluding in this way
to the acknowledgment of the Spanish colonies. In
the same spirit, and without any exaggeration, may it
be said that by the acknowledgment of Hayti we shall
provide a check to distant schemes of ambition, which
have latterly menaced an undue predominance in the
West Indies. In this view, the present proposition has
a political importance which it is difficult to measure.
It becomes a pledge of permanent peace, as well as of
commerce; but it can have this character only if made
effective, sincerely and honestly, according to the usage
of nations.</p>

<p>Of the many colonies following our example and independence
Hayti was the first, and yet, by strange perversity,
is not even now recognized by our Government.
We are told that the last shall be first and the first
shall be last. This, surely, is a case where the first is
last. It remains to be seen, if, under the genial influence
of such recognition, Hayti may not become, among
all independent colonies, first in importance to us, as
it was first in accepting our example.</p>

<p>In acknowledging the independence of Hayti, we follow
too tardily the lead of other nations. France for a
long time hesitated, as Spain hesitated, to acknowledge
the independence of her colonies. This concession was
made in 1825, under Charles the Tenth, while Hayti
stipulated by treaty to pay one hundred and fifty million
francs, as well for the recognition as for indemnification
to colonial proprietors. It was natural that the
mother country should hesitate; but when France abandoned
all claim, every objection to recognition by other
nations ceased. Accordingly, this republic has been
recognized, if not cordially welcomed, by Great Bri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>tain,
France, Spain, Prussia, Denmark, Holland, Belgium,
Portugal, Sweden, Hanover, Italy, and even by Austria,
all of whom have representatives there, duly chronicled
in the Almanach de Gotha.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus far I have confined myself to the case of Hayti.
But Liberia has claims of its own. If our commercial
relations with this interesting country are less important,
they are nevertheless of such consequence as to
require protection, while this republic may properly
look to us for parental care.</p>

<p>The commercial tables by which I have illustrated
so completely the relative importance of Hayti are less
precise with regard to Liberia, inasmuch as this republic,
owing to unhappy prejudices in recent Administrations,
was not allowed a separate place in the tables,
but was concealed under the head of “Other Ports
in Africa.” From authentic sources I learn that the
exports from the single port of Monrovia for the year
1860 amounted to near $200,000, while those from the
whole republic amounted to as much as $400,000.</p>

<p>I forbear details with regard to the commerce of
Liberia. It is enough that it is already considerable,
and is increasing in value, although Great Britain, by
a treaty, and the cultivation of friendly relations, has
done something to divert this commerce from the
United States. But it is not too late for us to enter
into a treaty, and to establish similar friendly relations.
If, beyond the impulse of self-interest, we need anything
to quicken us, we shall find it in the judgment of Henry
Clay, who, in a letter dated Ashland, October 18, 1851,
uses these positive words:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have thought for years that the independence of Liberia
ought to be recognized by our Government, and I have
frequently urged it upon persons connected with the Administration,&mdash;and
I shall continue to do so, if I have suitable
opportunities.”</p>

</div>

<p>In taking this step, and entering into a treaty with
Liberia, we only follow the example of commercial
nations. Nor can I doubt that we must in this way
essentially promote our own commercial interests. Liberia
is so situated, that, with the favor of the National
Government, it may become the metropolitan power on
the whole African coast, so that the growing commerce
of that continent will be to a great degree in its hands.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I do not dwell at length on the general advantages
from the recognition of these two powers, nor do I enlarge
on the motives of justice. I mean to state the
case simply, without introducing any topic which can
justly cause debate in this body. It is enough that the
acknowledgment is required for our own good. Happily,
in benefiting ourselves we shall promote the interests
of others.</p>

<p>There is one consequence which I cannot forbear to
specify. Emigrants to these Republics will be multiplied
by such recognition, while every emigrant, when
happily established, will create an additional demand for
the productions of our commerce, and contribute to the
number of American keels which plough the ocean.</p>

<p>And there is yet one other consequence, which ought
to be presented expressly. Our commerce will be put
at once under the solemn safeguard of treaty, so that it
will enjoy that security which is essential to its perfect
prosperity, and can no longer suffer from discriminating
duties or hostile legislation, aroused by a just sensibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
at our persevering illiberality. If you would have such
treaties, you must begin by an acknowledgment of independence.</p>

<p>Sir, there is one business only which can suffer by
this measure: I mean that of counterfeit money. You
know, Sir, that, by a familiar rule of International Law,
declared by the Supreme Court of the United States,<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> it
belongs exclusively to the political department of the
Government to determine our relations with a foreign
country. And since our Government refuses to acknowledge
Hayti, our courts of justice are obliged to do
so likewise; so that, when criminals are arraigned for
counterfeiting the money of Hayti, they decline all jurisdiction
of the offence. As Hayti is not a nation, it cannot
have money. Such is the reasoning, and the counterfeiters
go free. It is said that during the past thirty
years millions of false dollars have in this way been put
in circulation. A case has occurred only recently, where
the counterfeiter was promptly discharged, while the
witness alone seemed to be in danger. It is time that
such an outrage should be stopped.</p>

<p>It may be said that the same objects can be obtained
by consuls, instead of commissioners. It is clear that
it is not the habit of the United States to enter upon
negotiations and open friendly relations with foreign
states through consuls. And it is also clear, that, according
to the usage of nations, consuls are not entitled
to the same consideration with diplomatic representatives.
Their influence is less, whether in dealing with
the Government to which they are accredited, or with
the representatives of other powers at the same place.
On this point I content myself with reading the words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
of Mr. Wheaton.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Consuls are not public ministers. Whatever protection
they may be entitled to in the discharge of their official duties,
and whatever special privileges may be conferred upon
them by the local laws and usages, or by international compact,
they are not entitled by the general Law of Nations to
the peculiar immunities of ambassadors. No state is bound
to permit the residence of foreign consuls, unless it has stipulated
by convention to receive them. They are to be approved
and admitted by the local sovereign, and, if guilty of
illegal or improper conduct, are liable to have the exequatur
which is granted them withdrawn, and may be punished by
the laws of the state where they reside, or sent back to their
own country, at the discretion of the Government which they
have offended. In civil and criminal cases they are subject
to the local law, in the same manner with other foreign residents
owing a temporary allegiance to the state.”<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It may be true that negotiations are sometimes conducted
by consuls, but very rarely; and the exceptions
testify to the prevailing policy. Ministers are the received
agents of diplomacy. Any other agent must be
inferior in weight and character. If this be true,&mdash;and
it is undeniable,&mdash;then obviously the objects now proposed
can be most fitly and effectively accomplished
only by diplomatic representatives. And since what is
worth doing is worth well doing, I hope there will be
no hesitation. Here again the example of the great
European powers may properly influence us. England,
France, and Spain have diplomatic representatives at
Hayti, who are reputed to discharge their responsible
duties with activity and ability. All these have the
advantage of subsisting treaties. Our treaty remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
to be negotiated. To do this in such a way as to secure
for our various interests all proper advantages must
be our special aim. Any further neglect on our part
can be nothing less than open abandonment of these
various interests. Too long already has this sacrifice
been made.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. President, a full generation has passed since the
acknowledgment of Hayti was urged upon Congress.
As an act of justice too long deferred, it aroused even
then the active sympathy of multitudes, while as an act
for the benefit of our commerce it was ably commended
by eminent merchants of Boston and New York without
distinction of party. It received the authoritative support
of John Quincy Adams, whose vindication of Hayti
was associated with his best labors in the other House.
The right of petition, which he steadfastly maintained,
was long ago established. Slavery in the national capital
is now abolished. It remains that this other triumph
shall be achieved. Petitioners, who years ago
united in this prayer, and statesmen who presented the
petitions, are dead. But they will all live again in the
good work they generously began.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. President, this is the statement I have to make
on this important question. As I know that the Senator
from Kentucky [Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>] desires to move an
amendment, I shall not ask a vote to-day; but I propose
that the further consideration of the bill be postponed
until to-morrow at half past twelve o’clock, when
I hope we may have a vote upon it.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The motion was agreed to.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>

<p>April 24th, the Senate, as in Committee of the Whole, resumed the
consideration of the bill to authorize the President of the United States
to appoint diplomatic representatives to the Republics of Hayti and
Liberia respectively. Mr. Davis, of Kentucky, moved to strike out all
after the enacting clause, and insert:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the President of the United States be, and hereby is, authorized,
by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint a consul to the
Republic of Liberia, and a consul-general to the Republic of Hayti, respectively,
with powers to negotiate treaties of amity, friendship, and commerce
between the United States and those Republics.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the course of his remarks, Mr. Davis expressed himself as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;I am weary, sick, disgusted, despondent with the
introduction of the subject of Slaves and Slavery into the Chamber; and if I
had not happened to be a member of the committee from which this bill was
reported, I should not have opened my mouth upon the subject.… I oppose
the sending of ambassadors of any class from our Government to theirs upon
this consideration: it would establish diplomatically terms of mutual and
equal reciprocity between the two countries and us. If, after such a measure
should take effect, the Republic of Hayti and the Republic of Liberia
were to send their ministers plenipotentiary or their chargés d’affaires to
our Government, they would have to be received by the President, and by
all the functionaries of the Government, upon the same terms of equality
with similar representatives from other powers. If a full-blooded negro
were sent in that capacity from either of those countries, by the Laws of
Nations he could demand that he be received precisely on the same terms of
equality with the white representatives from the powers of the earth composed
of white people. When the President opened his saloons to the reception of
the diplomatic corps, when he gave his entertainments to such diplomats,
the representatives, of whatever color, from those countries, would have the
right to demand admission upon terms of equality with all other diplomats;
and if they had families consisting of negro wives and negro daughters, they
would have the right to ask that their families also be invited to such occasions,
and that they go there and mingle with the whites of our own country
and of other countries that happened to be present. We recollect that a few
years ago the refined French court admitted and received the representative
of Soulouque, who then denominated himself, or was called, the Emperor of
Dominica, I think.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> “Of Hayti.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Davis.</span> “Well, a great big negro fellow, dressed out with his silver
or gold lace clothes in the most fantastic and gaudy style, presented himself
in the court of Louis Napoleon, and, I admit, was received. Now, Sir, I
want no such exhibition as that in our capital and in our Government. The
American minister, Mr. Mason, was present on that occasion, and he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>sleeved by some Englishman&mdash;I have forgotten his name&mdash;who was present,
who pointed him to the ambassador of Soulouque, and said, ‘What do
you think of him?’ Mr. Mason turned round and said, ‘I think, clothes
and all, he is worth a thousand dollars.’ [<i>Laughter.</i>]</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>“Mr. President, I regret to have felt myself forced to speak the words
upon this subject I have. I do begin to nauseate the subject of Slaves and
Slavery in debate in this Chamber; and it was only because this measure
has been perseveringly and uniformly opposed from the Slave States heretofore,
and I know is distasteful, to a very considerable extent, to the people
of those States, and because the measure, in the form in which it has been
reported, would have the effect, in my opinion, to increase this feeling, that
I have thought it incumbent on me to say a word.”</p>

</div>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Mr. President, the Senate will bear
me witness, that, in presenting this important question
yesterday, I made no allusion to the character of the
population in the two Republics. I made no appeal on
account of color. I did not allude to the unhappy circumstance
in their history, that they had once been
slaves. It is the Senator from Kentucky who introduces
this topic. And not only this, Sir, he follows
it by alluding to some possible difficulties&mdash;I hardly
know how to characterize them&mdash;which may occur in
social life, should the Congress of the United States undertake
at this late day, simply in harmony with the
Law of Nations, and following the policy of civilized
communities, to pass this bill. I shall not follow the
Senator on those sensitive topics. I content myself
with a single remark. More than once I have had the
opportunity of meeting citizens of these Republics, and
I say nothing beyond the truth when I add that I have
found them so refined and so full of self-respect as to
satisfy me that no one of them charged with a mission
from his Government can seek any society where he
will be not entirely welcome. Sir, the Senator from
Kentucky may banish all personal anxiety. No representative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
from Hayti or Liberia will trouble him.</p>

<p>But the proposition of the Senator makes a precise
objection to the bill, which I am ready to meet. He
insists that we shall be represented by consuls only,
and not by diplomatic agents. Yesterday, in the remarks
I had the honor of addressing to the Senate, I
anticipated this very objection. I quoted then the authoritative
words of Mr. Wheaton in his work on the
Law of Nations, where he sets forth the distinction
between ministers and consuls, and shows the greater
advantage from a representation by one than by the
other. I follow up that quotation now by reading from
another work. It is a treatise on International Law
and the Laws of War by General Halleck; and as I
quote this authority, which is not yet much known, I
venture to remark that I doubt if there is any recent
contribution to the literature of the Law of Nations of
more practical value. In a few words he states the
character of consuls. I quote from him as follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Consuls have neither the representative nor diplomatic
character of public ministers. They have no right of ex-territoriality,
and therefore cannot claim, either for themselves,
their families, houses, or property, the privileges of
exemption which by this fiction of law are accorded to
diplomatic agents, who are considered as representing, in a
greater or less degree, the sovereignty of the state which
appoints them. They, however, are officers of a foreign
state, and, when recognized as such by the exequatur of the
state in which they exercise their functions, they are under
the special protection of the Law of Nations. Consuls are
sometimes made also chargés d’affaires, in which cases they
are furnished with credentials, and enjoy diplomatic privileges;
but these result only from their character as chargés,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>and not as consuls.”<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Committee who had the subject in charge, taking
it into careful consideration,&mdash;as I believe the Senator
from Kentucky, who is a member of the Committee,
will confess,&mdash;deliberately reached the conclusion that
it was advisable for the United States at present to
be represented at each of those Republics by a person
of diplomatic character. The Committee put aside the
proposition that we should be represented merely by a
consul. It was felt that such an officer would not adequately
do all that our country might justly expect to
have done. Nor is this all. We were guided also by
the precedents of our Government. There are eighteen
different states lower down in the scale of commerce
and navigation with the United States, where we
are now represented by diplomatic representatives. One
of these, as I explained yesterday, is the Sandwich Islands,
with a population of only seventy thousand, and
with a commerce and navigation vastly inferior to that
between the United States and Hayti.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Davis.</span> I think we have too many.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Possibly. I go into no inquiry on
that point. Suffice it to say we already have these
eighteen diplomatic representatives, and one of these
is at the Sandwich Islands, with a population, a commerce,
and navigation inferior to those of Hayti. Besides,
at the Sandwich Islands we have three consuls
highly paid. If we have too many, let us reduce the
list, but do not commence our economies on Hayti and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
Liberia.</p>

<p>The Committee in their conclusion followed the usage
of nations, and also the example of the great powers at
Hayti. In presenting this measure, I make no appeal
on account of an oppressed race. I urge it simply as
an act for our own good. We go about the world hunting
up the smaller powers, where to make treaties and
to place diplomatic representatives, under the temptation
of petty commercial advantage. Thus far we have
stood aloof from two important opportunities of extending
and strengthening our influence. It is time to
change.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The proposition of Mr. Davis was rejected,&mdash;Yeas 8, Nays 30.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Saulsbury, of Delaware, then said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“After the vote just taken in the Senate, I shall not trespass upon their
attention, as I intended to do,&mdash;only for a brief period, however. It is
evident that this bill is going to pass. I want the country, however, to
know that according to the rules of the Senate foreign ministers have a
right upon this floor, and we have set apart a portion of the gallery for the
ministers and their families. If this bill should pass both Houses of Congress
and become a law, I predict that in twelve months some negro will
walk upon the floor of the Senate of the United States and carry his family
into that gallery which is set apart for foreign ministers. If that is agreeable
to the taste and feeling of the people of this country, it is not to mine;
and I only say that I will not be responsible for any such act. With this I
will content myself.”</p>

</div>

<p>The question, on the passage by yeas and nays, resulted, Yeas 32,
Nays 7.</p>

<p>So the bill was passed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>June 3d, the bill passed the House,&mdash;Yeas 86, Nays 37.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The passage of this bill was felt to be an important stage in the warfare
with Slavery. Governor Andrew saw it so, and wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p><div class="blockquote">

<p>“The triumphant and exemplary majority which the Hayti bill obtained
in the Senate is most gratifying. I am greatly rejoiced. The law, when
passed, will be a recognition of the <em>Colored Man</em>, not merely of Hayti. It is
a jewel in your crown.”</p>

</div>

<p>Joshua Leavitt, of New York, the tried Abolitionist, also saw it so,
and wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Allow me to congratulate you on the splendid vote in the Senate on
Haytien recognition. I think it shows the benefit of waiting for the right
time, and then striking. This action is final in regard to the supremacy of
the Slave Power. How can they administer a government that is in amity
with a nation of insurgent negro slaves?”</p>

</div>

<p>The joy in Hayti was reported by Seth Webb, Jr., our Commercial
Agent at Port-au-Prince.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We all admire the way you steered the recognition through the Senate,
and can only hope for as good a pilot in the House.</p>

<p>“The news of the passage of the Recognition Bill through the Senate was
received here about the same time with that of the taking of Yorktown and
Williamsburg, and diffused real joy among all classes. The American residents
illuminated their houses, and had a good time generally.</p>

<p>“Your speech on the passage of the Recognition Bill attracts great attention
here, and, when printed in full, will be extensively read.”<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Benjamin C. Clark, an eminent merchant, acting as Consul of
Hayti at Boston, wrote with the feelings of an American citizen, as well
as of a Haytien representative.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The passage of the bill under your thorough exposition of the subject
will be a big white stone in our pathway as a nation, and a gravestone to
the vampires and Vandals who have left nothing by the wayside but works
of treason leading to bloodshed and desolation.”</p>

</div>

<p>The feelings of the Haytien people were communicated by the following
letter.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium">“<span class="smcap">Consulate of Hayti, New York</span>, 26 April, 1862.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have the honor to express my high appreciation of the important

gratitude of all liberal and benevolent persons who desire justice and political

a people who, under many embarrassments, have nobly maintained their
position, and are daily advancing in intellectual culture and in the refinements
of civilized life.…</p>

<p>“I know the character of the Haytiens thoroughly, having lived among
them some fifteen years, eight years of the time as Commercial Agent of the

which touches with benignant power upon the great home of this race, and
which, combining with the generous and beneficent policy of other great

<h2><a name="FINAL_SUPPRESSION_OF_THE_SLAVE-TRADE" id="FINAL_SUPPRESSION_OF_THE_SLAVE-TRADE"></a>FINAL SUPPRESSION OF THE SLAVE-TRADE.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, on the Treaty with Great Britain,
April 24, 1862.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>Early in the spring of 1862, Mr. Seward conferred with Mr. Sumner
on a treaty with Great Britain for a mutual and restricted right of
search and mixed courts, with a view to the suppression of the slave-trade.
The negotiation was opened and proceeded successfully. April
7th, Mr. Sumner, being at the State Department, had the happiness of
witnessing the signature of this treaty by Mr. Seward and Lord Lyons.
April 11th, it was communicated to the Senate in Executive Session,
and referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations. April 15th, it
was reported to the Senate by Mr. Sumner, with the recommendation
that the Senate advise and consent thereto. April 22d, it was brought
up in the Senate, when Mr. Sumner moved the usual resolution of ratification.
April 24th, on motion of Mr. Sumner, the Senate proceeded
to consider the resolution of ratification. The yeas and nays were dispensed
with by unanimous consent, and the resolution was agreed to
without a dissenting vote.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;Already a slave-trader has
been executed at New York, being the first in
our history to suffer for this immeasurable crime.<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> English
lawyers dwell much upon treason to the king, which
they denounce in a term borrowed from ancient Rome
as <i>lese</i>-majesty; but the slave-trade is treason to man,
being nothing less than <i>lese</i>-humanity. Much as I incline
against capital punishment, little as I am disposed
to continue this barbarous penalty, unworthy of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
civilized age, I see so much of good in this example at
the present moment, that I reconcile myself to it without
a pang. Clearly it will be a warning to slave-traders,
and also notice to the civilized world that at
last we are in earnest, while it helps make the slave-trade
detestable. Crime is seen in the punishment, and
the gallows sheds upon it that infamy which nothing
short of martyrdom in a good cause can overcome.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The important treaty now before the Senate is to enforce
on a large scale final judgment against the slave-trade.
It is to do with many what has just been done
with an individual. Our flag is desecrated by this hateful
commerce; ships equipped in New York are tempted
by its cruel gains. To stop this has been impossible,
while Slavery prevailed in the National Government.
How could our courts judge the slave-trader, how could
the National Government set itself against the hateful
commerce, while Slavery occupied all the places of
power? But this is changed. If Emancipation is yet
longer delayed, Slavery is at least dislodged from its
predominant influence. Therefore is the way free for
action against the slave-trade.</p>

<p>The treaty proceeds on the idea of earnest work, and
it recognizes two especial agencies, each of which has
been discussed between the two Governments in former
years, but has always failed of adoption. The first is a
mutual and restricted right of search, and the second is
the well-known system of mixed courts, for the enforcement
of the treaty.</p>

<p>The treaty has just been read, so that I need not
recite in detail the terms of these two provisions. I
pass at once to the consideration of their origin and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
necessity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There was a time when our country was open and
earnest against the slave-trade. A well-known provision
of the Constitution, classed among original compromises,
restrained Congress from prohibiting it prior to
the year 1808; but, just so soon as it had the power,
Congress acted. Its promptitude justified the enthusiasm
with which Judge Story in his Commentaries
remarks: “It is to the honor of America that she should
have set the first example of interdicting and abolishing
the slave-trade in modern times.”<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> By Act of Congress,
bearing date as early as March 2, 1807, and to take effect
January 1, 1808, the importation of slaves into the
United States was prohibited, under penalties of imprisonment,
fine, and forfeiture. These were increased by
Act of Congress of April 20, 1818. But mild and moderate
enactments were not enough; and at length, by
Act of May 15, 1820, Congress was constrained to declare
the slave-trade piracy, and to punish it with death.
Since then this offence has stood in the catalogue of
capital crimes.</p>

<p>Already this immense subject had occupied the attention
of the great European powers. In the Treaty of
Paris in 1814, Great Britain and France united against
what was denounced as “a species of commerce equally
repugnant to the principles of natural justice and the
lights of the times.”<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> This was followed by the Treaty
of Ghent, at the close of the same year, in which the
United States and Great Britain denounced the traffic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
in slaves as “irreconcilable with the principles of humanity
and justice,” and promised their best endeavors
for its suppression.<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> Then came the Treaty of Vienna,
where the great powers joined in declaring it “repugnant
to the principles of humanity and of universal
morality.”<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> These were declarations only. The next
attempt was to find a system of action, which should
be effective against the Protean monster in the many
metamorphoses it was able to assume, and here England
nobly took the lead.</p>

<p>Lord Castlereagh instructed the Duke of Wellington,
the British ambassador at Paris, to obtain from France
the concession of a mutual right of search for the enforcement
of the denunciation in which they were agreed;
but this was found unwelcome to the French Government,
and therefore not pressed at the time. Such was
the beginning of the proposition, which, after various
fortunes, is at last recognized in the treaty now before
us.</p>

<p>Meanwhile negotiations were opened on our side particularly
with Great Britain. These seem for a time to
have had the sanction not only of the Executive, but of
Congress, or at least of the House of Representatives.
Messages from the President, calling attention to the
slave-trade, were answered by reports from special committees
of the House of Representatives. One of these,
made February 9, 1821, concluded with a resolution,
“That the President of the United States be requested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
to enter into such arrangements as he may deem suitable
and proper with one or more of the maritime
powers of Europe for the effectual abolition of the African
slave-trade.” The report, while declaring that “to
efface this reproachful stain from the character of civilized
mankind would be the proudest triumph that could
be achieved in the cause of humanity,” proceeds to announce,
in words applicable to the present moment, that
“this happy result, experience has demonstrated, cannot
be realized by any system, except a concession by the
maritime powers to each other’s ships of war of a qualified
right of search.”<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> Another report, by a select committee
of the House, April 12, 1822, adopted the resolution
of the previous committee, and also the recommendation
of a mutual right of search, adding, that it
could not be doubted “that the people of America have
the intelligence to distinguish between the right of
searching a neutral on the high seas in time of war,
claimed by some belligerents, and that mutual, restricted,
and peaceful concession by treaty, suggested by your
Committee, and which is demanded in the name of suffering

<p>Then came the devoted efforts of Charles Fenton
Mercer, an admirable representative of Virginia, who
exposed this terrible traffic with a pathos not to be forgotten.
On his motion, another resolution was adopted,
February 28, 1823, by a vote of one hundred and thirty-one
yeas to only nine nays, calling upon the President
to enter into negotiations “for the effectual abolition of
the African slave-trade, and its ultimate denunciation as
piracy, under the Law of Nations, by the consent of the
civilized world.”<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> The character of this resolution was
impaired by the rejection of an amendment, “and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
we agree to a qualified right of search,”<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> which was a
falling off from the recommendations of the two committees.</p>

<p>The Executive responded to Congress, and, under
instructions from John Quincy Adams, Secretary of
State, a treaty was negotiated with Great Britain, bearing
date March 13, 1824, in which it was stipulated
that the ships of the two powers might “cruise on the
coasts of Africa, <em>of America</em>, and of the West Indies,
for the suppression of the slave-trade,” and empowering
them under certain restrictions to detain and capture
vessels engaged in this traffic.<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> Important in substance,
this treaty became important historically. Although
the clause quoted appeared in the original draught
sent out from Washington, yet the treaty was ratified
by the Senate only on the condition that the words
“of America” were struck out, thus excluding operations
of British cruisers along the whole extent of
American coast.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> This was fatal to the treaty, as the
British Government would not accept the condition.
The case is memorable, not only as a check to negotiations
for the suppression of the slave-trade, but as a
conspicuous instance, where the Senate, in dealing with
a power like Great Britain, did not shrink from asserting
its prerogative under the Constitution, not less decisive
than the tribunitial veto.</p>

<p>Thus it stood. Our own Government had proposed a
modified search on the coast of America, but this was
point-blank refused by the Senate. It appears that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
proposition was made contrary to the judgment of Mr.
Adams. His sense of wrong from the long-continued
search exercised by British cruisers was so keen that
he would not willingly furnish any excuse for its revival;
and such, it was feared, might be the concession.
Afterwards, in the revelations which he sometimes made
to the House of Representatives, he declared his repugnance
to this negotiation, and the way it was overcome.
The same repugnance, doubtless, influenced Senators in
the vote on the treaty, increased by a growing sentiment
for Slavery, which the debates on the Missouri
Compromise had quickened.</p>

<p>Mr. Adams’s statement made in debate at a later day
lets us behind the scenes at an important period. After
describing the proposition for a mutual right of search,
the veteran said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It was utterly against my judgment and wishes; but I
was obliged to submit, and I prepared the requisite despatches
to Mr. Rush, then our minister at the court of
London. When he made his proposal to Mr. Canning,
Mr. Canning’s reply was, ‘Draw up your convention, and I
will sign it.’ Mr. Rush did so, and Mr. Canning, without
the slightest alteration whatever, without varying the dot of
an <i>i</i> or the crossing of a <i>t</i>, did affix to it his signature,&mdash;thus
assenting to our own terms in our own language. The
convention came back here for ratification; but in the
mean while another spirit came over the feelings of this
House, as well as of the Senate. A party had been formed
against the Administration of Mr. Monroe; the course of the
Administration was no longer favored, and the House came
out in opposition to a convention drawn in conformity to its
own previous views.… The Senate ratified the treaty,
giving the right of search in the fullest manner to Great
Britain, with the exception, I think, of one article, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>extended the right to the coast of the United States: that
was rejected.”<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This statement from an eminent quarter shows how
at another time the opposition to a mutual right of
search became manifest. It is for the Senate to determine
if the time has not come for this opposition to
cease.</p>

<p>Not disheartened by failure with the United States,
Great Britain pursued her honorable policy, enlisting
Government after Government, until nearly all the
maritime powers of Europe, moved by a common sentiment
of humanity, had conceded a mutual and restricted
right of search, with the single object of suppressing
the slave-trade. The famous Quintuple Treaty
of 1841 between the great powers consecrated the same
principle on a wider theatre; but, owing to the extraordinary
efforts of General Cass, our Minister at Paris,
France was induced to withhold her assent, yielding,
I fear, to an irritated Anglophobia and to the growing
pretensions of Slavery. The treaty was duly ratified
by Great Britain, Russia, Prussia, and Austria. As
a substitute, stipulations for naval coöperation were
adopted between Great Britain and France,&mdash;also between
Great Britain and the United States. And still
Great Britain persevered in this glorious championship,
until, in 1850, it was her boast that she stood party to
no less than twenty-four treaties denouncing the slave-trade,
of which ten conceded a mutual right of search
and mixed courts, twelve conceded search with trial only
before home tribunals, and two provided for naval coöper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>ation.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>This summary brings us to the present treaty, where
we find a mutual and restricted right of search and
mixed courts for certain purposes, but with the trial of
criminals only before home tribunals.</p>

<p>If at an earlier day there was reason to be sensitive
about any concession of the right of search, especially
to Great Britain, always so exacting on the ocean, that
day has happily passed. The reason ceasing, so also
should the opposition cease. Even if the acknowledged
power of the United States and the enlightened opinion
of the civilized world did not remove the liability to
abuse, making it so absolutely impossible as not to be
an element in the case, we cannot forget a recent signal
event, when Great Britain openly renounced that tyrannous
pretension which so stirred the soul of the whole
American people, never again to assert it. This was
done in solemn demand for the rendition of Mason and
Slidell, who had been taken by a national cruiser, acting
in precise conformity with early and constant British
practice. Therefore on this account there need be
no solicitude. Conceding search for the suppression of
the slave-trade, we furnish no excuse and open no door
for that other search, always so justly offensive, which
finally brought war in its train. Such a concession now
is only an addition to international policy demanded
by the civilization of the age.</p>

<p>Nor need there be any jealousy on account of Slavery;
for this power is disappearing. If, unhappily, it is
not yet extinct, if it still lingers in prolonged malignant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
existence, it has ceased to sway the National Government.
Therefore I see no reason why the sensibilities
of its partisans should be consulted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another possible objection to the treaty is more
technical. This also was presented by John Quincy
Adams, when he spoke of mixed courts “as inconsistent
with our Constitution,”<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> because the judges are
not appointed, nor do they hold office, according to its
well-known requirements. But this objection, if entitled
to any consideration, is mitigated in the present
treaty, which hands over the slave-trader for trial in
the home courts of the captor, leaving to the mixed
courts only the condemnation and destruction of the
slave-ship. But whatever doubts might have prevailed
at an earlier period, when the question was less understood,
it is plain now that this objection is wholly superficial
and untenable. Besides courts known to the
Constitution and subject to its requirements, there are
others extra-constitutional, like courts in the Territories,
where the judges hold for four years instead of during
good behavior, and yet are recognized by the Supreme
Court of the United States.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> Like Territorial courts,
mixed courts are plainly extra-constitutional, standing
on the treaty power and the practice of nations,&mdash;as
courts martial are also extra-constitutional, standing on
the war power and the practice of nations.</p>

<p>Among frequent means for the determination of international
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>questions are mixed courts or mixed commissions
in various forms, where different nations are
represented. Such tribunals are the natural incident of
treaties, and were recognized as such at the beginning
of our history. Nor is it easy to see how treaties can
be consummated without their ancillary help. A mixed
commission, where our country was represented, sat at
London under Jay’s Treaty, deciding numerous cases;
and similar commissions have been sitting ever since.
The Jay Commission was originally criticized on the
ground that judicial power cannot be vested except
according to the Constitution,<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>&mdash;being the very objection
to mixed courts in anti-slave-trade treaties, that occupied
so much attention at a later day, and to which
I am now replying. But nobody now doubts that this
commission was proper. The proposed tribunal, though
differing in purpose, proceeds from the same fountain
of power. It is kindred in character and origin. Now,
without considering if the objection to mixed courts is
not equally strong against a crowned head as arbitrator,
as when the French Emperor sat in judgment on
the long-pending litigation between the United States
and Portugal in the <i>General Armstrong</i> case, it is obvious
that all the international tribunals constituted
by treaty, whether an emperor or a commissioner, are
sustained by unbroken usage as well as by reason. To
insist that the restrictions of the Constitution, evidently
intended for the national judicature, are applicable to
these outlying tribunals, is to limit the treaty power
and to curtail the means of justice beyond the national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
jurisdiction. Mixed courts are familiar to International
Law, and our country cannot afford to reject them, least
of all on a discarded technicality which would leave us
isolated among nations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It remains only that we make haste to ratify the
treaty, nor miss the great opportunity. A moment
lost is a concession to crime. Therefore must we be
prompt.</p>

<p>Foreign nations will not fail to recognize this open
pledge to Human Rights, and the Rebels will discern
a new sign of the national purpose. Abroad and at
home we shall be strengthened. The Rebellion itself
will feel the blow, and ambitious Slavery foresee its
doom.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>As soon as the vote was announced in the Senate, Mr. Sumner hastened
to Mr. Seward at the State Department. It was five o’clock
in the afternoon, and the Secretary was reposing on a sofa. On hearing
the words, “The treaty is ratified unanimously,” he exclaimed,
“Where &mdash;&mdash; were the Democrats?” His joy was great, and Lord
Lyons, on learning the result, was not less happy. It is much in a
diplomatic career to sign any treaty, but it was an event to have signed
a treaty promising the final extinction of an infinite scandal and curse
to humanity.</p>

<p>Subsequent action was prompt. The treaty was ratified by the Senate
April 24th; ratifications were exchanged in London May 25th;
the treaty was proclaimed by the President June 7th, 1862.</p>

<p>June 10th, a message of the President, transmitting a copy of the
treaty, with correspondence between Mr. Seward and Lord Lyons in
relation to it, was laid before the Senate, and on motion of Mr. Sumner
referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations, and ordered to be
printed.</p>

<p>June 13th, Mr. Sumner reported from the Committee a bill to carry
the treaty into effect, providing for the appointment, with the advice
and consent of the Senate, of a judge and also an arbitrator on the part
of the United States to reside at New York, a judge and also an arbitrator
to reside at Sierra Leone, and a judge and also an arbitrator to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>reside at the Cape of Good Hope,&mdash;all the judges to be paid $2,500
annually, the arbitrator at New York $1,000, and the arbitrators at
Sierra Leone and the Cape of Good Hope $2,000 respectively.</p>

<p>Owing to the pressure of business incident to the latter days of a
very crowded session, Mr. Sumner was not able to call it up immediately.
June 26th, on his motion, it was considered and passed:
Yeas, 34; Nays, only 4.</p>

<p>Among the nays was Mr. Saulsbury, of Delaware, who remarked:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I do not object to the suppression of the African slave-trade, but I do
not believe that this Government has the constitutional right to establish any
such court. I think the treaty ought not to have been adopted.”</p>

</div>

<p>July 7th the bill passed the House, and July 11th was approved by
the President.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The importance of this treaty had not been exaggerated. The <i>Journal
des Débats</i>, organ of French intelligence at Paris, in its enunciation,
June 15, 1862, of the objects accomplished by the National Government,
says: “There is a treaty with England, which, loyally executed,
must soon render the slave-trade almost impossible.”</p>

<p>The slave-trade became almost impossible, so that practically it ceased
to exist. The terror of the law, with these provisions for its enforcement,
sufficed at last to deter the perpetrators of this inhuman crime,
and the ocean, so often traversed by slave-ships, became like a peaceful
metropolis with a well-ordered police.</p>

<p>This great result was without the capture of a single vessel. It was
enough that at last we were in earnest. Judges and arbitrators found
themselves without employment, when, in an appropriation bill, of
March 3, 1869, Congress called on the President, with the consent of
Great Britain, to terminate that part of the treaty requiring mixed
courts and their annual outlay.<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> This was done by treaty between
the two powers, signed at Washington, June 3, 1870; so that the
mutual right of search for the suppression of the slave-trade alone
remained.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>April 18th, Mr. Sumner offered the following resolution, which was
considered by unanimous consent, and adopted.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the Secretary of the Interior be requested to furnish, for
the use of the Senate, a list of all persons residing in the District of Columbia
who appear in the returns of the last census as owners of slaves, indicating
the number claimed to be owned by each person, with the classification of
their ages according to the returns.”</p>

</div>

<p>April 28th, the Secretary of the Interior accompanied the return
with the suggestion, that, as it exposed the private affairs of individuals,
it was questionable “whether it would be proper to print it for
circulation.” On hearing this communication read at the desk, Mr.
Sumner moved its reference to the Committee on the District of
Columbia, and remarked:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;In offering the resolution, I
felt that I was doing good service to the Commissioners
appointed to carry out our recent measure of
Emancipation, and I felt also that I was helping to correct
possible abuses in anticipation of its operation.</p>

<p>I have been sorry to hear of efforts during the last
few weeks to run able-bodied slaves out of the District.
Slavery is often called a patriarchal institution, and I
am anxious to see how many of the patriarchs, in avoidance
of the action of Congress, have transported slaves
beyond the reach of its beneficent power. Such an outrage
ought to be exposed. I confess that I find no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
good reason for delicacy towards persons so guilty. I
am sure that freedom and truth will be gainers, when
such conduct is laid bare. I cannot doubt that the object
proposed is important.</p>

<p>These statistics should be brought before the Senate,
if not before the country. They will be needed by the
Commissioners, and I am sure they will do something
to illustrate the character of Slavery.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The motion was agreed to.</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, on a Resolution of Inquiry, May 1, 1862.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>May 1st, on motion of Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts, the Senate resumed
the consideration of the following resolution, submitted by him
on the 3d of April.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the Committee on Military Affairs and the Militia be directed
to consider and report whether any further legislation is necessary to
prevent persons employed in the military service of the United States from
aiding in the return of or control over persons claimed as fugitive slaves, and
to punish them therefor.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;Some time has elapsed since
we listened to the persuasive speech of the Senator
from Iowa [Mr. <span class="smcap">Grimes</span>], but, unhappily, the subject
is fresh still. The character, if not the efficiency,
of our armies is concerned in the complete enforcement
of the late legislation with regard to slaves. If this
legislation be set at defiance, or evaded, I think that
our military strength will be impaired, and I am sure
that our good name must suffer.</p>

<p>I am grateful to the Senator from Iowa for the frankness
with which he exposed and condemned the recent
orders of several of our generals.</p>

<p>One of these officers, though last from California, was
originally of Massachusetts. He served honorably in
the Mexican War, and, I believe, is an excellent soldier.
His present position as a general is due partly to my
exertions. I pressed his appointment. But, had I for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
a moment imagined he could do what he has just perpetrated,
he would never have had my support. When
an officer falls bravely in defence of his country, honest
pride mingles with the regret that we feel. But when
an officer falls as General Hooker has now fallen, there
is nothing but regret. He has fallen, although not
dead. I say this with pain; but I cannot say less.</p>

<p>The order of General Hooker has been quoted by the
Senator from Iowa [Mr. <span class="smcap">Grimes</span>]. I ask leave to read
part of a letter which I have received from his camp.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I take the liberty of forwarding to you the enclosed
order of General Hooker, with a report of its results, thinking
that you will be interested to know how the late Act of
Congress forbidding the rendition of slaves by army officers
is violated, and hoping that some effort may be made to
prevent such unjust and outrageous measures on the part of
superior officers.</p>

<p>“Our moral and humane feelings have been violated by
having been compelled to witness the attempts of slave-holders,
known to be of Secession proclivities, coming into
our camps and searching our private quarters for their
slaves, under the cover of a protecting order from a general
who exceeds his authority.”</p>

</div>

<p>This letter expresses feelings natural to a humane
bosom. In contrast with General Hooker, I call attention
to the course of General Doubleday, whose head-quarters
are here in Washington. I read his order.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium">“<span class="smcap">Headquarters, Military Defences north of the Potomac,<br />
Washington</span>, April 6, 1862.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I am directed by General Doubleday to say, in
answer to your letter of the 2d instant, that all negroes
coming into the lines of any of the camps or forts under his
command are to be treated as persons, and not as chattels.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>

<p>“Under no circumstances has the commander of a fort or
camp the power of surrendering persons claimed as fugitive
slaves, as it cannot be done without determining their character.</p>

<p>“The additional article of war recently passed by Congress
positively prohibits this.</p>

<p>“The question has been asked, whether it would not be
better to exclude negroes altogether from the lines. The
General is of the opinion that they bring much valuable information
which cannot be obtained from any other source.
They are acquainted with all the roads, paths, fords, and
other natural features of the country, and they make excellent
guides. They also know, and frequently have exposed,
the haunts of Secession spies and traitors and the existence
of Rebel organizations. They will not, therefore, be excluded.</p>

<p>“The General also directs me to say that civil process
cannot be served directly in the camps or forts of his command,
without full authority be obtained from the commanding
officer for that purpose.</p>

<p class="sig">“I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,</p>

<p class="sig2">“<span class="smcap">E. P. Halsted</span>, <i>Assistant Adjutant-General</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent medium">“<span class="smcap">Lieutenant-Colonel John D. Shaul</span>,<br />
<i>Commanding Seventy-Sixth Regiment New York Volunteers</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>General Doubleday acted bravely at Fort Sumter;
but he did not render a truer service to his country on
that occasion than he has now done in this order. If
this example were followed everywhere in our camps,
we should at least save ourselves from shame, if we did
not secure victory.</p>

<p>Other generals at the West think they do their duty
best, when they serve Slavery. There is General McCook,
of whom we have the following sad report, on the
authority of a paper at Nashville, recounting th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>e visit
of a slave-hunter to his camp.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He visited the camp of General McCook, in Maury
County, in quest of a fugitive, and that officer, instead of
throwing obstacles in the way, afforded him every facility
for the successful prosecution of his search. That General
treated him in the most courteous and gentlemanly manner,
as also did General Johnson, and Captain Blake, the brigade
provost-marshal. Their conduct toward him was in all respects
that of high-toned gentlemen desirous of discharging
their duties promptly and honorably. It is impossible for
the army to prevent slaves from following them; but whenever
the fugitives come into the lines of General McCook,
they are secured, and a record made of their names and the
names of their owners. All the owner has to do is to apply
either in person or through an agent, examine the record or
look at the slaves, and, if he finds any that belong to him,
take them away.”</p>

</div>

<p>Can we listen to such a statement and not feel indignant
at the levity with which human freedom is
treated?</p>

<p>Yet similar cases multiply. There is the provost-marshal
of Louisville, who seems to be a disgrace to
our army, if we may believe the following report.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Here Mr. Sumner quoted at length the description of his conduct:
making colored people “his subjects of oppression and inhuman treatment”;
“ordering his provost guards to flog all colored persons out
after dark”; “now being revenged on the colored people for their faithfulness
to the Union cause.”<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But, Sir, an incident has occurred under General Buell’s
command which cannot be read without a blush.
Here it is, as described in the letter of a s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>oldier who
was more than a witness, even a party to it. I find
this letter in a newspaper, but it has been furnished
to me in manuscript by the person to whom it is addressed.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium">“<span class="smcap">Camp Andy Johnson, near Nashville,<br />
Tennessee</span>, March 8, 1862.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">My dear Parents</span>,&mdash; … A great outrage was perpetrated
in our camp yesterday, as follows.</p>

<p>“A black boy, named Henry, has been at work for the
Colonel for some days. His owner came after him while we
were camped on the other side of the river, but the boys
hooted him out of camp. The negro said he would sooner
be killed on the spot than go back with his master, even if
he knew he would not be punished. His master, he said,
was a Secessionist, and had kept him (the boy) on some fortifications
down the river at work for four mouths.</p>

<p>“Nothing more transpired concerning his return until
yesterday. While the greater part of the regiment were
out on picket, the boy’s owner came with two sentinels of
the provost guard from the city, and, after chasing the poor
frightened boy through the camp several times,&mdash;he drawing
a knife once, and the sentinel knocking him down with
his musket,&mdash;they captured and delivered him to his owner,
who stood waiting outside the lines. The latter paid the
catching sentries fifteen dollars each, and led Henry away
with him unmolested, flourishing a pistol at his head as he
went. They had no order&mdash;at least, showed none&mdash;for the
boy from head-quarters, and the Lieutenant-Colonel of our
regiment, who was in command, need not have delivered him
up without such an order, yet allowed him to be caught, and
the Major forbade our boys from giving him any assistance.
One of the sentinels was from a Kentucky, and one from an
Indiana regiment.…</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>

<p>“The former master of our boy will not get him without
an order, and an imperative one, I believe; and if one is
given for him,&mdash;his master having been a strong and active
Secessionist, a quartermaster for the Southern army, in fact,&mdash;I
have about concluded to follow it by immediate resignation,
and this, whether the order be for him or any other
negro. The order would make it an official act. What do
you think my duty would be in the premises?”</p>

</div>

<p>Of General Buell I know nothing personally; but
such an incident must fill us with distrust. He may
possess military talent, he may be a thunderbolt of war;
but it is clear that he wants that just comprehension
of the times and that sympathy with humanity without
which no officer can do his complete duty.</p>

<p>But General Buell may, perhaps, shelter himself behind
the instructions of his superior officer; and this
brings me to the famous Order No. 3 of Major-General
Halleck. I have it in my hands, and quote these
words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We will prove to them that we come to restore, not to
violate, the Constitution and the laws.… The orders
heretofore issued from this department in regard to pillaging,
marauding, and the destruction of private property, and
stealing and the concealment of slaves, must be strictly enforced.
It does not belong to the military to decide upon
the relation of master and slave: such questions must be
settled by the civil courts. <em>No fugitive slaves will, therefore,
be admitted within our lines or camps, except when specially
ordered by the General commanding.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p>In this order, so strangely inconsistent, absurd, unconstitutional,
and inhuman, the General perversely
perseveres. In every aspect it is bad. It wants common
sense, as well as common humanity. It is unworthy
a man of honor and a soldier.</p>

<p>It is inconsistent with itself, inasmuch as the General
proclaims that he “comes to restore, not to violate, the
Constitution and the laws,” and then proceeds to a direct
violation of them. In the same order he says: “It does
not belong to the military to decide upon the relation of
master and slave: such questions must be settled by
the civil courts.” And then, in the face of this declaration,
he proceeds to say that “no fugitive slaves will
be admitted within our lines or camps.” But pray, Sir,
how can such persons be excluded from lines or camps
without deciding that they are fugitive slaves? This
flat and discreditable inconsistency is in harmony with
the whole order.</p>

<p>But worse than its inconsistency is its absurdity.
This watchful, prudent General proposes to exclude all
fugitive slaves from his camps. In other words, he
shuts out all opportunities of information with regard
to the enemy naturally afforded by this class of deserters.
They may come charged with knowledge of movements
and plans; but the General will not receive them,
because they are slaves. They may be able to disclose
the secret of a campaign; but the General will not have
it, because they are slaves. If we have failed thus far
in knowledge of the enemy’s designs, it is because this
absurd policy has prevailed.</p>

<p>General Halleck may be instructed by General McDowell,
whose opposite conduct shines in a despatch
published in the papers.</p>

Saturday morning. This last has just been confirmed by
another negro.</p>

<p class="sig">“<span class="smcap">Irvin McDowell</span>, <i>Major-General</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Here are two negroes coming into camp with important
information, both of whom General Halleck’s
order would repel and drive back to bondage. And he
may be instructed by the despatch of General Wool,
just received, announcing our success at New Orleans,
the news of which came by a “fugitive black.” The
General adds: “The negro bringing the above reports
that the Rebels have two iron-clad steamers nearly completed,
and that it is believed that the Merrimac will be
out to-morrow.” But all this information would be shut
out by General Halleck. Can absurdity be more complete?</p>

<p>But worse than inconsistency or absurdity is its positive
unconstitutionality. What right, under the Constitution,
has this General to set himself up as judge
in cases of human freedom? Where does he find his
power? By whom has he been invested with this attribute?
It is the boast of the National Constitution that
all are “persons.” The National Constitution so regards
everybody, and surrounds everybody with the safeguards
of “persons,” even to the extent of declaring that “no
person shall be deprived of <em>liberty</em> without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span> due process
of law.” And yet the army is gravely told to treat certain
persons as slaves. Of course this cannot be without
sitting in judgment most summarily on human freedom.
How does the General know that they are slaves? On
what evidence? Because they are black? Why may
they not be free blacks? General Halleck would reverse
the true presumption. He assumes Slavery, when
he ought to assume Freedom. In the eye of the Constitution
all are freemen until proved to be slaves, no matter
of what color. The only question to be asked concerns
loyalty. Are you loyal or rebel? If loyal, then
welcome to the hospitality and protection of our camps.
If rebel, then surrender to our arms. Be these the inquiries,
with this rule, and the Union we seek to restore
will not be indefinitely postponed.</p>

<p>But worse than its unconstitutionality is the inhumanity
of this order, so shocking to the moral sense.
This General, professing to fight the battle of the Constitution
with the commission of the Republic, speaks
of “the concealment of slaves” in the same class with
“pillaging, marauding, and stealing.” I complain of
this confusion of language, showing an insensibility to
human rights. It is like those shameful advertisements
which garnish Southern newspapers, where “the boy
Tom” and “the girl Sally” are to be sold in the same
lot with “horses, mules, cattle, and swine.” That such
an order should be put forth in the name of our country
may justly excite indignation.</p>

<p>On these various grounds I object to this order. In
this criticism, which I make with sincere sorrow, I confine
myself to the order. General Halleck is reputed
an able officer, and I am sure he is an able lawyer.
I do not intend to question his various capacity. But
I do protest against his perverse violation of the Constitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
to carry out a miserable and disgraceful proslavery
policy; and I protest against his being allowed to
degrade the character of our country. Sir, we are making
history. Every victory adds something to that history;
but such an order is worse for us than defeat.
More than any defeat it will discredit us with posterity,
and with the friends of liberal institutions in foreign
lands. I have said that General Halleck is reputed an
able officer; but, most perversely, he undoes with one
hand what he does with the other. He undoes by his
orders the good he does as a general. While professing
to make war upon the Rebellion, he sustains its chief
and most active power, and degrades his gallant army
to be the constables of Slavery.</p>

<p>How often must I repeat that Slavery is the constant
Rebel and universal enemy? It is traitor and belligerent
together, and is always to be treated accordingly. Tenderness
to Slavery now is practical disloyalty and practical
alliance with the enemy.</p>

<p>Believe me, Sir, against the officers named to-day
I have no personal unkindness. I should much prefer
to speak in their praise; but I am in earnest.
While I have the honor of a seat in the Senate, no
success, no victory, shall be apology or shield for a
general who insults human nature. From the midst
of his triumphs I will drag him forward to receive the
condemnation which such conduct deserves.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>This movement ended in the Bill for Confiscation and Liberation,
approved July 17th, which provided for the freedom of the slaves of
Rebels. The enactments on this subject were embodied by the President
in the first Proclamation of Emancipation, September 22, 1862.</p>

ON REGIMENTAL COLORS.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Resolution in the Senate, May 8, 1862.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>In a despatch announcing the capture of Williamsburg, May 6th,
General McClellan inquired whether he was “authorized to follow
the example of other generals and direct the names of battles to be
placed on the colors of regiments.” This gave occasion to the following
resolution, moved by Mr. Sumner.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">RESOLVED, That, in the efforts now making for
the restoration of the Union and the establishment
of peace throughout the country, it is inexpedient
that the names of victories obtained over our fellow-citizens
should be placed on the regimental colors of
the United States.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Hale objected to its consideration; so it was postponed.</p>

<p>May 13th, Mr. Wilson introduced a joint resolution to authorize the
President to permit regiments of the volunteer forces to inscribe on
their flags the names of battles in which such regiments have been
engaged; but no further action was had upon it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Sumner’s resolution excited comment at the time. The <i>National
Intelligencer</i> remarked:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Now that public attention has for the first time been called to the subject,
we presume there will be on the part of many an instinctive approval
of the grounds on which Senator Sumner condemns the custom thus originated
and practised by ‘other generals.’ … When the Union is restored
and peace has been reëstablished, we take it that the regimental colors of
the United States will preserve no trace either of Union <em>victories</em> or Union
<em>defeats</em>. The name of ‘Springfield,’ in Missouri, would otherwise perpetually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>remind us of the unhappy fall of Lexington in that State.”</p>

</div>

<p>An excellent citizen of New York, Alfred Pell, wrote that “exactly
what Congress should do with base Secession standards and flags was
pointed out by Mrs. Brownrigg, who</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent2">“‘whipped two female ’prentices to death,</div>
<div class="verse"><em>And hid them in the coal-hole</em>.’”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Other testimony was from an undoubted authority, being none other
than Lieutenant-General Winfield Scott, in his autobiography. After
quoting the famous resolution which Rufus King laid upon the table of
the Senate, February 18, 1825, fifteen days before he finally left that
body, which he calls “a benign resolution,” to the effect, that, as soon as
the remnant of the national debt should be discharged, the net proceeds
of the whole of the public lands should constitute a fund for Emancipation,
the Lieutenant-General proceeds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The resolution stands a national record. Here is statesmanship, farsightedness.…
Here is magnanimity, considering the hostility of the
South on account of Mr. King’s powerful resistance to the admission of Missouri
into the Union with Slavery. Here is a Christian’s revenge, returning
good for evil. All honor to a great deed and a great name!.…</p>

<p>“I place in juxtaposition with the foregoing a kindred sentiment that
gleamed in the same body on a more recent occasion.</p>

<p>“It had been proposed, without due reflection, by one of our gallant
commanders engaged in the suppression of the existing Rebellion, to place on
the banners of his victorious troops the names of their battles. The proposition
was rebuked by the subjoined resolution, submitted by the Hon. Mr.
Sumner, May 8, 1862.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then quoting the resolution, the Lieutenant-General adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This was noble, and from the right quarter.”<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">RESOLVED, That the Select Committee on the
confiscation of Rebel property be directed to consider
the expediency of providing, that, in all judicial

<div class="medium">

<p>This was objected to by Mr. Saulsbury, of Delaware, but on the next
day it was agreed to.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Select Committee failing to adopt this provision in the bill
reported by them, entitled “A bill to suppress insurrection, punish
treason and rebellion, and for other purposes,” Mr. Sumner sought to
engraft it on the bill by motion in the Senate.</p>

<p>June 28th, Mr. Sumner moved the following amendment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“And in all proceedings under this Act there shall be no exclusion of any
witness on account of color.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Clark, of New Hampshire, Chairman of the Select Committee,
said, that, “while they had no hostility to the general principle of the
amendment, they thought it was better not to engraft it upon this
bill.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner replied:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>This bill is to operate in the Slave States. But, with
the rule of evidence prevailing there, I see insuperable
difficulties in the way of conviction. If Congress choose
to authorize criminal proceedings against Rebels, as is
done by this bill, then in good faith they must see that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
the proceedings are not entirely nugatory, through failure
of evidence, under the operation of an irrational
rule of exclusion.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Clark said, that the Committee was influenced by the consideration,
that under the bill slaves would become free on the conviction
of their masters for treason; and the Committee “thought it
would look a little like inducing the slave to come forward and swear
against the master, … if we put such a provision in the bill; and
we rejected it on that ground.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner replied:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>But the Senator will not forget that there are other
slaves besides those of the master under trial, as well as
colored persons who are not slaves. Whether slaves or
not, even if freemen, the Senator knows well that there
is one cruel rule of evidence everywhere in the Rebel
States, which excludes the testimony of colored persons.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The amendment was rejected: Yeas 14, Nays 25.</p>

<p>This was the third move against exclusion of witnesses on account of
color.<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<h2><a name="THE_LATE_HON_GOLDSMITH_F_BAILEY" id="THE_LATE_HON_GOLDSMITH_F_BAILEY"></a>THE LATE HON. GOLDSMITH F. BAILEY,
REPRESENTATIVE FROM MASSACHUSETTS.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, on his Death, May 15, 1862.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;The last Representative of
Massachusetts snatched away by death during
the session of Congress was Robert Rantoul, Jr. Ripe
in years and brilliant in powers, this distinguished person
tardily entered these Halls, and he entered them not
to stay, but simply to go. Congress was to him only
the antechamber to another world. Since then ten years
have passed, and we are now called to commemorate
another Representative of Massachusetts snatched away
by death during the session of Congress. Less ripe in
years and less brilliant in powers, Mr. Bailey occupied
less space in the eyes of the country; but he had a soul
of perfect purity, a calm intelligence, and a character of
his own which inspired respect and created attachment;
and he, too, was here for so brief a term that he seems
only to have passed through these Halls on his way,
without, alas! the privilege of health as he passed.</p>

<p>Born in 1823, Mr. Bailey had not reached that stage
of life, when, according to a foreign proverb, a man has
given to the world his full measure;<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> and yet he had
given such measure of himself as justified largely the
confidence of his fellow-citizens. This was the more
remarkable, as he commenced life without those advantages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
which assure early education and open the
way to success. At two years of age he was an orphan,
of humble parentage and scanty means. From school
he followed the example of Franklin, and became a
printer. There is no calling, not professional, which to
an intelligent mind affords better opportunities of culture.
The daily duties of the young printer are daily
lessons. The printing-office is a school, and he is a
scholar. As he sets types, he studies, and becomes
familiar at least with language and the mystery of
grammar, orthography, and punctuation, which, in early
education, is much; and if he reads proofs, he becomes
a critic. At the age of twenty-two our young printer
changed to a student of law, and in 1848 was admitted
to the bar.</p>

<p>In the very year of his admission to the bar the
question of Slavery assumed unprecedented proportions,
from the efforts made to push it into the Territories of
the United States. Although he took no active part
in the prevailing controversy, it must have produced its
impression on his mind. It was to maintain prohibition
of Slavery in the Territories, and to represent this
principle, that he was chosen to Congress.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> In a speech
at the time he upheld this cause against the open opposition
of its enemies and the more subtle enmity of
those who disparaged the importance of the principle.
Never had Representative a truer or nobler constituency.
It was of Worcester, that large central county of
Massachusetts, and broad girdle of the Commonwealth,
which, since this great controversy began, has been always
firm and solid for Freedom. To represent a people
so intelligent, honest, and virtuous was in itsel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>f no
small honor.</p>

<p>But with this honor came those warnings which
teach the futility of all honor on earth. What is honor
to one whom death has already marked for his own?
As life draws to its close, the consciousness of duty
done, especially in softening the lot of others, must be
more grateful than anything which the world alone can
supply. Even the spoiler, Death, cannot touch such a
possession. And this consciousness rightly belonged to
the invalid who was now a wanderer in quest of health.
Compelled to fly the frosts of his Massachusetts home
during the disturbed winter of 1860, when these civil
commotions were beginning to gather, he journeyed
nearer to the sun, and in the soft air of the Mexican
Gulf found respite, if not repose. There he was overtaken
by that blast of war, which, like</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“A violent cross wind from either coast,”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">swept over the country. Escaping now from the menace
of war in Florida, as he had already escaped from
the menace of climate in Massachusetts, he traversed
the valley of the Mississippi, and succeeded in reaching
home. At the session of Congress called to sustain the
Government he appeared to take his seat; but a hand
was fastened upon him which could not be unloosed.
Again he came to his duties here during the present
session; for while the body was weak, his heart was
strong. He often mourned his failing force, because it
disabled him from speaking and acting at this crisis.
He longed to be in the front rank. Yet he was not a
cipher. He was a member of the Committee on Territories
in the House of Representatives, and its
Chairman<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> relates that this dying Re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>presentative was earnest
to the last that his vote should be felt for Freedom.
“Let me know when you wish my vote, and, though
weak, I shall surely be with you,” said the faithful son
of Massachusetts. This is something for his tombstone;
and I should fail in just loyalty to the dead, if I did not
mention it here.</p>

<p>As a member of this Committee, he put his name to a
report which became at once a political event. In the
uneventful life of an invalid, who was here for a few
weeks only, it should not be passed over in silence. By
a resolution adopted on the 23d of December, 1861,<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> the
Committee on Territories was instructed “to inquire
into the legality and expediency of establishing Territorial
Governments within the limits of the disloyal States
or districts.” After careful consideration of this momentous
question, the Committee reported a bill to establish
temporary provisional governments over the districts of
country in rebellion against the United States.<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> This
bill assumed two things, which, of course, cannot be
called in question: first, that throughout the Rebel
region the old loyal State Governments had ceased to
exist, leaving no person in power there whom we could
rightfully recognize; and, secondly, that the Constitution
of the United States, notwithstanding all the efforts
of Rebellion, was still the supreme law throughout this
region, without a foot of earth or an inhabitant taken
from its rightful jurisdiction. Assuming the <em>absence</em>
of State Governments and the <em>presence</em> of the National<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
Constitution, the bill undertook, through the exercise of
Congressional jurisdiction, to supply a legitimate local
government, with a governor, legislature, and court;
but it expressly declared that “no act shall be passed,
establishing, protecting, or recognizing the existence of
Slavery; nor shall said temporary government, or any
department thereof, sanction or declare the right of one
man to property in another.” In a succeeding section
it was made the duty of the authorities “to establish
schools for the moral and intellectual culture of all the
inhabitants, and to provide by law for the attendance of
all children over seven and under fourteen years of age
not less than three months in each year.” With a thrill
of joyful assent Mr. Bailey united with the majority of
the Committee in this bill. It was his last public act,
almost his only public act in Congress, and certainly
the most important of his public life. As a record of
purpose and aspiration it will not be forgotten.</p>

<p>To such a measure he was instinctively moved by
the strength of his convictions and his sense of the
practical policy needed for the support of the Constitution.
He had no indulgence for the Rebellion, and
saw with clearness that it could be ended only by the
removal of its single cause. His experience at the
South added to his appreciation of the true character of
Slavery, and increased his determination. He did not
live to see this Rebellion subdued, but he has at least
left his testimony behind. He has taught by what
sign we are to conquer. He has shown the principle
which must be enlisted. Better than an army is such
a principle; for it is the breath of God.</p>

<p>Mr. Bailey was clear in understanding, as he was
pure in heart. His life was simple, and his manners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
unaffected. His, too, were all the household virtues
which make a heaven of home, and he was bound to
this world by a loving wife and an only child. He was
happy in being spared to reach his own fireside. Sensible
that death was approaching, he was unwilling to
continue here among strangers, and, though feeble and
failing, he was conveyed to Fitchburg, where, after a
brief period among kindred and friends, he closed his
life. His public place here is vacant, and so also is
his public place in Massachusetts. But there are other
places also vacant: in his home, in his business, and
in his daily life among his neighbors, in that beautiful
town scooped out of the wooded hills, where he was
carried back to die.</p>

the Senate, and the President of the United States.
Under our rules this is called <em>enrolling</em>, although in
England, where it originated, it was known, down to
its recent abolition there, as <em>engrossing</em>.</p>

<p>I have said that it is calculated to arrest attention.
This is because to most persons it is a novelty, although
old in itself. On inquiry, I do not learn that it is continued
in any of our States except Massachusetts. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
the new States of the West it has never been known.
The question which I now submit is, Whether it is
wise for Congress to continue this embarrassing form,
already discontinued, or never adopted, by the State
Legislatures?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Among the Joint Rules of the two Houses is the following,
entitled “Enrolled Bills.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“After <em>a bill</em> shall have passed both Houses, it shall be
duly <em>enrolled</em> on parchment by the Clerk of the House of
Representatives, or the Secretary of the Senate, as the bill
may have <em>originated</em> in the one or the other House, before
it shall be presented to the President of the United
States.”</p>

</div>

<p>This was adopted as early as 6th August, 1789.
Shortly before this date, at the recommendation of
Senators Morris, Carroll, Langdon, Read, and Lee, a
joint resolution was passed, requiring the Secretary
of the Senate and the Clerk of the House, within ten
days after the passing of every Act of Congress, to authenticate
printed copies thereof, and lodge them with
the President.<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> In September, 1789, a statute was
passed to provide for the safe keeping of the acts, records,
and seal of the United States, by the first section
of which the Department of Foreign Affairs was changed
to the Department of State. The Secretary of the Department
thus remodelled was made custodian of all
bills, orders, resolutions, or votes of Congress approved
by the President, or having become laws or taken effect
without his approval, with directions to publish the
same in the newspapers, to cause one printed copy to be
delivered to each Senator and Representative, and two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
printed copies, duly authenticated, to be sent to the
Governor of each State, and to “carefully preserve the
originals.”<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> This latter service has been executed by
binding the enrolled copies of the acts of each session
in separate volumes, without rolling or folding the skins
of parchment, and depositing them in a fire-proof vault,
under the immediate charge of an officer of the State
Department, known as Clerk of the Rolls.</p>

<p>The enrolment of bills requires special care, and
sometimes even delays legislation. From the haste
with which the transcription is often made and the
amendments are embodied, errors naturally occur. Perhaps
these cannot be entirely avoided by copies on paper.
Indeed, nothing can supersede the necessity of
great vigilance, whether paper or parchment be employed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The main reason for enrolment on parchment, when
first adopted by Congress, was English example. Technical
phrases, tautologous terms, absurdities of law Latin
and law French, all these, together with our jurisprudence,
were borrowed directly from England, and with
them came parchment, the use of which antedated these
peculiarities. Of course it was before the manufacture
of paper in England, which was not earlier than the
reign of Henry the Seventh, and it was continued long
after the manufacture had rendered it unnecessary.</p>

<p>In Antiquity other substances were employed; but
among European nations in modern times, previous to
the invention of paper, parchment prevailed. In England,
every manuscript, every book, every deed, every
indenture, every contract, every record, judici<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>al or other,
was on parchment. So, also, was Magna Charta, wrung
from King John in 1215, and still exhibited as a venerable
curiosity in the British Museum. It must have
been the case with the statutes and proceedings of
Parliament; for, in fact, there was little else on which
they could be written. These proceedings, together
with the statutes, constituted what were called the
Rolls of Parliament,&mdash;<i>Rotuli Parliamentorum</i>,&mdash;and
they were preserved apart, with other parchment records.
There is a verse of Scripture which has been
quoted as describing the place where they were kept:
“Darius the king made a decree, and search was made
in <em>the house of the rolls</em>, where the treasures were laid
up.”<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p>The durability of parchment is attested by the manuscripts
which illumine the great libraries of Europe.
Among the treasures of the Vatican is a Virgil of the
fourth century, and in the National Library of Paris is
a Prudentius of an early date, both in a condition to
survive the structures in which they are preserved.
Abbeys, convents, churches, built with pious skill, have
crumbled to dust, while their parchments continue to
defy the tooth of Time. But this peculiar durability,
so important before the invention of printing, when
copies were few, has played its part.</p>

<p>Parchment soon gave way to paper in judicial proceedings
and records, probably from considerations of
economy and convenience; but it continued longer in
parliamentary proceedings. The Journals of the House
of Lords, which have always been held to be public
records, were formerly “recorded every day on rolls of
parchment.”<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> The original usage with regard to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
Journals of the other House seems to have been different;
for we find in 1621, the year after the sailing of
our Pilgrim Fathers, an express order that the Journals
of the House of Commons “shall be reviewed and
recorded on rolls of parchment.”<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> Notwithstanding
the order, this usage does not appear to have prevailed
with the Commons, and it was long ago discontinued
by the Lords. But the statutes continued to be engrossed
on parchment, and placed in the custody of the
“Master of the Rolls.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>According to English practice, engrossment took place
after the report. But at last, in 1848, it was thought
advisable to make a change. The whole subject occupied
committees of both Houses, and finally of Parliament
itself. Even at the cost of details which may be
wearisome, I present the history of these proceedings,
which will be interesting, at least, as showing the care
which presided over this transition, and also a possible
guide to us.</p>

<p>On the 4th of September, 1848, the day before the
prorogation of Parliament, it was ordered in the House
of Lords,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the Clerk Assistant be directed, in communication
with the proper authorities of the House of Commons, to
take such preliminary steps as may be necessary, so as to
enable the House, if it shall so think fit, at the commencement
of the next session, to dispense with the present form
of engrossing bills, and to transmit and to receive printed
copies of the same.”<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Clerk Assistant, thus directed to report, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>John George Shaw Lefevre, Esquire, brother of the
accomplished Speaker of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>On the third day of the next session, February 6, 1849,
the Lord Chancellor informed the House of Lords,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the Clerk Assistant had prepared and laid on the
table, in obedience to the resolutions of this House, a report
of the result of his communication with the authorities of
the House of Commons on the subject of dispensing with the
present form of engrossing bills.”<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

</div>

<p>A select committee to consider the proposed change,
was appointed, consisting of the Lord Chancellor, Lord
Privy Seal, Duke of Richmond, Earl of Shaftesbury, Lord
Beaumont, and Lord Monteagle of Brandon.</p>

<p>It is probable that they adopted at once the suggestions
of the Clerk Assistant, as, within a few hours after
their appointed meeting, their Chairman, the Lord Chancellor,
reported to the House of Lords, February 8, 1849,
that the Committee had met and considered the subject-matter
referred to them, and united in recommending,
“That it is expedient to discontinue the present
system of engrossing, and to alter the present system
of enrolling bills”; and they reported provisions, in lieu
thereof, to which I shall refer.</p>

<p>The House of Lords adopted the report, passed the
resolutions, and ordered that they be communicated to
the Commons at a conference, and their concurrence
desired.<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

<p>On the 9th of February, managers of the conference
were appointed. Those representing the House of Lords
were the Lord Privy Seal, Earl Waldegrave, Earl Saint
Germans, Viscount Hawarden, Lord Bishop of Hereford,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
Lord Beaumont, and Lord Monteagle of Brandon. The
managers representing the House of Commons were Sir
George Grey, Sir Robert Peel, Sir Robert Harry Inglis,
Mr. Herries, Mr. Wilson Patten, Mr. Bernal, Sir John
Yarde Buller, the Earl of Lincoln, Mr. Attorney-General,
the Earl of Arundel and Surrey, Mr. Thornely,
Mr. Maitland, Mr. Hume, Mr. Mackenzie, the Judge
Advocate, and Sir John Young.</p>

<p>Omitting other details, I come at once to the resolutions
afterwards adopted in both Houses.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“1. That, in lieu of being engrossed, every bill shall be
printed fair immediately after it shall have been passed in
the House in which it originated, and that such fair printed
bill shall be sent to the other House as the bill so passed,
and shall be dealt with by that House and its officers in
the same manner in which engrossed bills are now dealt
with.</p>

<p>“2. That, when such bill shall have passed both Houses
of Parliament, it shall be fair printed by the Queen’s printer,
who shall furnish a fair print thereof on vellum to the House
of Lords before the royal assent, and likewise a duplicate of
such fair print, also on vellum.</p>

<p>“3. That one of such fair prints of each bill shall be
duly authenticated by the Clerk of the Parliaments, or other
proper officer of the House of Lords, as the bill to which
both Houses have agreed.</p>

<p>“4. That the royal assent shall be indorsed in the usual
form on such fair print so authenticated, which shall be deposited
in the Record Tower, in lieu of the present engrossment.</p>

<p>“5. That the copies promulgated in the first instance by
the Queen’s printer shall be impressions from the same form
as the deposited copy.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>

<p>“6. That for the present session this arrangement shall
not apply to private bills, nor to local and personal bills,
which last mentioned bills, intended to be brought in this
session, have been for the most part already printed, in
pursuance of the standing orders of the House of Commons.</p>

<p>“7. That the Master of the Rolls shall, upon being duly
authorized in that behalf, receive, in lieu of the copies of
public general acts as now enrolled, the herein before-mentioned
duplicate fair print of each public general bill, to be
held for the same purposes and subject to the same conditions
for and upon which the enrolled acts are now received
and held by him.</p>

<p>“8. That it is expedient, with a view to economy, convenience,
and dispatch, and to the diminution of the chance
of errors, that one printer should print the public general
bills for both Houses; and that, inasmuch as the Queen’s
printer is, by virtue of his office, bound to print the acts, it
would be advisable, for the attainment of the before-mentioned
objects, that the Queen’s printer should be employed
by both Houses to print the public general bills.”<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Later in the same session of Parliament, the House
of Commons passed the following resolution, which was
agreed to by the House of Lords on the 31st of July,
1849.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That the arrangement contained in the resolutions
agreed to by both Houses of Parliament on the 12th day of
February last, relative to the engrossing and enrolling of
bills, (except so much thereof as relates to the expediency
of one printer printing the bills for both Houses,) shall in
future sessions apply to local, personal, and private, as well
as to public bills.”<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus in England the old system of engrossing and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>enrolling has disappeared. It is true that the bill, in
its last stage, is printed on vellum; but the ancient
cumbersome proceeding is abolished.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have referred especially to English practice, because
ours was originally derived from it. But the example
of a nation so truly enlightened as France may be properly
adduced also. The ordinances of the kings of
France were engrossed on parchment down to the reign
of Louis the Fourteenth, when his great minister, Colbert,
contented himself with having them copied in a
fair hand on folio paper, and bound in large volumes.
The voluminous ordinances of the Grand Monarch on
the Government of Canada, and of the Mississippi Valley,
then recently discovered, are still preserved in the
<i>Archives de la Marine</i> at Paris, each one bearing the
signature of the sovereign, and countersigned by his
minister. Thus in France, even before the great changes
of the Revolution, parchment was discarded, and I am
not aware that it is now used either in judicial or legislative
proceedings. The records and documents, all fairly
copied on paper, are admirably preserved, untouched by
time or damage of any kind, and in better condition than
some of our own public documents written within the
last ten years. I do not forget that the clerks of the last
century wrote with carefully prepared ink on linen paper.
Bad ink and cotton paper must, of course, be avoided,
especially where metallic pens are employed to tear the
surface and open the way for the deleterious fluid.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If disposed to follow the examples of England and
France, and of our own States in their local Legislatures,
we shall make a change. Nor is there any reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
of utility or convenience in favor of parchment. I
know that a vellum page is a luxury, coveted always by
the refined book-collector; but it has long since ceased
to be anything else. Paper is good enough and durable
enough for all practical purposes. Volumes of the fifteenth
century, among the first fruits of the newly discovered
art of printing, are found now in as good condition
as when their paper was first blackened by types;
and there are manuscripts, not merely on parchment,
but also on paper, older than the discovery of America,
in as good condition as the Journals of the Senate.</p>

<p>Even if paper were less permanent than parchment,
the latter becomes entirely superfluous since the practice
was established of printing the statutes under the
supervision of the Government. It is well known that
public statutes require no proof besides the printed
statute-book.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> This was an original principle of English
law, which has been adopted and fortified among
us. Professor Greenleaf, who is such authority on the
Law of Evidence, thus exhibits the value of the printed
copy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is the invariable course of the Legislatures of the
several States, as well as of the United States, to have the
laws and resolutions of each session printed by authority.
Confidential persons are selected to compare the copies with
the original rolls, and superintend the printing. The very object
of this provision is to furnish the people with authentic
copies; and, from their nature, <em>printed copies of this kind,
either of public or private laws, are as much to be depended on</em>
as the exemplification verified by an officer who is a keeper
of the record.”<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Summing up the whole case, we find that the present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>system has its origin in ancient usage, the reason of
which has long since ceased; that there is no necessity
for its continuance; that it is contrary to convenience;
that it is contrary to the example of France, and even
of England, whence it was derived; that it is contrary
to the usage of our own States, in their legislative action;
and that a change would do something, at least,
to simplify our proceedings.</p>

<p>Paper is of all qualities, and of every degree of durability.
Besides rags, there are many other substances
out of which it is made, so that even the increasing demand
meets a corresponding supply. It is always cheap,
and entirely convenient. To reject it for parchment is as
if we imitated the early Arabs, and inscribed our statutes
on the shoulder-blades of sheep. The skin is less antediluvian
than the bone, but both are out of place in our age.</p>

<p>Should the change be deemed advisable, it might
be made by substituting the words “linen paper” for
“parchment,” in the sixth Joint Rule. This would be
simple enough: but the phrases “engrossed” and “enrolled”
would still remain in the rules, although the
occasion for them had passed. In the British Parliament,
the old form of question, “That this bill be engrossed,”
which always followed after the Committee of
the Whole, is now dispensed with;<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> and it seems to me
that we might do something to simplify our proceedings
in this respect, also.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have here a complete collection of bills, as printed,
at their different stages in the two Houses of Parliament,
as follows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span></p>

<p>Bill as delivered to each member of the House of
Commons.</p>

<p>House copy of bill originating in the Commons.</p>

<p>Bill as presented by the Commons to the Lords, after
passing the Commons.</p>

<p>Bill as delivered to each peer.</p>

<p>House copy of bill originating in the Lords.</p>

<p>Bill as presented by the Lords to the Commons, after
passing the Lords.</p>

<p>Bill on vellum, as passed both Houses, and ready
for the royal assent.</p>

<p>All these I shall, if he will allow me, hand over to
the Chairman of the Committee on Enrolled Bills, who
will do something, I trust, for the improvement of our
rules in this respect.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The resolution was adopted, but no report was ever made by the
Committee.</p>
